Personal breviary is accessible web form.

My breviary includes a version of morning prayer for a man who needs to make coffee and go to work.  It's shorter than the Morning Prayer of the hours and is more pertinent to the 21st century American adult male.

The breviary also includes some mass helpers if I find myself in a mass that is not my native language. It includes novenas that I have rewritten to not be lame.  It includes some thoughts on theology and bible study that I put out there as an argument or discussion starter.
