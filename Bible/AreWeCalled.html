				<p class="lead">I'm going to argue that we're not called to be disciples</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Those he meets</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Our bishops and pastors have stated repeatedly that we're all called to be disciples. The ministers are not perfect people, but they are called by Jesus and appointed by the Holy Spirit to guide us in matters like these.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are unanswered gaps in this statement. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The first problem is that scipture is pretty clear that very few were called to be disciples. The second problem is the definition of disciple.  Do we need to follow Stephen and Paul to a gruesome death? Do we need to give up everything and give it to the poor? If not, what is the minimum waterted down version of "disciple" that I am called to?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Who is called.</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The man formerly in the tombs wants to follow Jesus, but instead Jesus tells him to go home to his friends and family to tell them what happened. There are others that Jesus cures where he forbids them from telling anybody what happened. Where do we draw the line between Andrew and Peter versus people Jesus healed?  What about the 5,000 people Jesus fed?  
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				What makes this encounter unique is that the rich man didn't want healing or forgiveness, he just wanted to confirm that he is good.  
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The qualifications</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Luke 9 kicks off 5 chapters that <i>discourage</i> discipleship. First of all, there are numerical limits.  There are the three, James, John and Peter.  Then there are the 12, followed by the 72.  The 5,000, a group that I feel comfortable being part of, are not disciples. Samaria doesn't even want the disciples to visit.  Luke 9 is peppered with qualifications: take up your cross, deny yourself, be the least - like a child, don't expect to have a place to spend the night, leave your family and don't look back.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Note Luke 12:22: "He said to his disciples". Jesus talks to the crowds, he talks to Pharasees, and he talks to his disciples. In this particular case, the tells then not to worry about what they will eat and to sell their belongings and give the money to the poor. Jesus is more direct in Luke 14. <i>If anyone doesn't hate his family, he cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. Everyone of you who does not renounce all his possessions cannot be my disciple.</i>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If we are all called to be his disciples, then all but a select few of the 350 million people in this country actually said yes. The rest of us said no.
				</p>
			</div>						
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Current Interpretation</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The lesson of the virgins story is that you have to wait for the Spirit. It's going to be a long haul, and not fun. It's dark and late, and you're tired.  It's boring. You're buddies are going to be distracted and walk away. They will ridicule you for waiting on the way out. You will feel stupid and have no proof other than the simple fact that you are waiting.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The lesson of the talents is that you don't have time to wait. You have to get out there today and trade what you've got. What you have, worth $15,000,000 in today's currency, is your faith. Get out there, in some way appropriate to who you are, today, and share your faith. You only get one day, and it's today.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				The lesson of the last story in Matthew 25 is that no matter what you do, it must involve serving the poor, prisoners, and migrants. These are not optional. 
				</p>
			</div>						
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Watered down discipleship</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				The term martyr applies to a very special calling - a person who is willing to give up his life for his faith, in many cases undergoing torture or other horrific pains on the way to death, such as watching family members die.  The first step of martyrdom is to give things up as needed, like your place in line or the last donut.  The next step is to let someone be wrong and not say anything.  There are 200 more steps, but only your death qualifies you as an actual martyr.  Nonetheless, it's trending to let everyone be martyrs in their daily life. This is an abuse of language and renders the term 'martyr' meaningless.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In the same way, we're all disciples now.  But we're not.
