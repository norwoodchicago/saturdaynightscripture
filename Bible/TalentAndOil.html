				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">Talent and oil</h1>
				<p class="lead">Two really hard passages can be found in Matthew 25</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Unforgiving</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				These passages appear to be inconsistent with the rest of the Gospel.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In the parable of the 10 virgins, 5 of them foolish and 5 mean ones who refuse to share, the story ends with the groom locking out the 5 foolish virgins and decrying that he doesn't know them.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In the parable of the talents, the master rewards commerce and trade and takes from those who don't have and gives to those who do have. The version in Luke 19 adds a group of disgruntled servants who the master has killed in his presence at the end of the story.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The clue is context</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Jesus is addressing his disciples instead of the crowds. These are his last words before he is dragged away and tortured to death. In Matthew Chapter 24, Jesus describes how bad it's going to be in the end times. Matthew Chapter 26 starts with the announcement of the crucifixion and concludes with Peter's third denial of Jesus.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Chapter 25 is a tough piece of jerky between two hard pieces of bread.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Leading questions</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Are we all called to be disciples?  Are we in the end times? Does Jesus really care how adept we are at trading and commerce? What does he care about?
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In the last part of chapter 25, each person is judged based on their care of the poor, migrants, and prisoners. Is this a continuation of the theme of this chapter or does each story represent a different option to follow Jesus?
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Luke spends about 5 chapters trying to disuade readers from being disciples by describing how hard it is going to be. Is chapter 25 of Matthew his attempt to turn away potential followers? Are we really all called to be disciples? Does Jesus have a realistic view of how many will stick it out until the end? 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Is this one of those passages that you ponder for 10 years and come up with 10 different yet equally valid messages?
				</p>
			</div>						
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Current Interpretation</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The lesson of the virgins story is that you have to wait for the Spirit. It's going to be a long haul, and not fun. It's dark and late, and you're tired.  It's boring. You're buddies are going to be distracted and walk away. They will ridicule you for waiting on the way out. You will feel stupid and have no proof other than the simple fact that you are waiting.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The lesson of the talents is that you don't have time to wait. You have to get out there today and trade what you've got. What you have, worth $15,000,000 in today's currency, is your faith. Get out there, in some way appropriate to who you are, today, and share your faith. You only get one day, and it's today.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				The lesson of the last story in Matthew 25 is that no matter what you do, it must involve serving the poor, prisoners, and migrants. These are not optional. 
				</p>
			</div>						
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Alternatives</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				I'm not against all three of these passages applying equally at the same time. Our Catholic faith is full of two contradictory answers to the same question. The first and second stories are going to define your discipleship on a daily basis.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The alternative is that the first two stories define cold or hot. Each story has a different audience among potential disciples. Story number three is for people who are not called to be disciples.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Perhaps the third story answers 2 questions. It concludes the first story by answering the quesiton "what do I do while I'm waiting" and it concludes the second story by answering the question "exactly how do I effectively share my faith?"
