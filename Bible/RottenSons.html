				<p class="lead">The story of King David is interleaved with inept fathers raising bad sons</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Eli</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Eli, father of Hophni and Phinehas, opens the book of Samuel.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The future mother of Samuel, Hannah, is praying intently for a child. Eli is the ministering priest.  Eli doesn't recognize prayer and chastises Hannah for drunkenness.  Eli doesn't recognize prayer.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In chapter 2, Eli warns his sons to stop exploiting the women who serve at the entry of the meeting tent.  Eli's sons ignore him and Eli takes no further action.  A real prophet would have slain the offenders in his prophet zeal, probably with a bone of some kind.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In chapter 2, the wicked Hophni and Phinehas violoate the prescribed procedures for sacrifice because they are gluttons.  Where did we learn this behavior?  The hint is in the report of Eli's death in chapter 4 of Samuel: "Eli fell backward from his chair into the gateway; he died of a broken neck since he was an old man and heavy".  He was 98, and heavy.  
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				I think we have enough to explain how Eli could raise rotten sons.  Eli doesn't know prayer, he doesn't know fasting, and he doesn't know discipline.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Chapter 3 begins with this line: "During the time young Samuel was minister to the LORD under Eli, the word of the LORD was scarce and vision infrequent."  This means something, but I'm not sure what.  One possibility is that Eli doesn't spend any time listening. Another is that God has given up trying to get the attention of the priests and is waiting for Samuel to mature.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Is Samuel any better?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Samuel is one of the great prophets of Isreal. In Samuel 6, he gets all of Isreal to return to the Lord. There is fasting. They confess. He does so many other great things that two books in the bible are need to record his role.  Unfortunately, being a good dad is not one of his achievements.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In chapter 8, "His sons did not follow his example, but looked to their own gain, accepting bribes and perverting justice." Samuel was old at this time and his sons would take over at his death. This is in fact the reason that the Isrealites give for wanting a king. How could someone as good as Samuel raise such bad sons?
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There is a hint at the end of chapter 7.  "Samuel judged Israel as long as he lived. He made a yearly circuit, passing through Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpah and judging Israel at each of these places. Then he used to return to Ramah, for that was his home. There, too, he judged Israel and built an altar to the LORD." It appears that Samuel was never home.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The timeline for his traveling duties is not clear. At the beginning of chaptuer 7, we're told that the Ark rested at Kiriath-jearim for 20 years.  This is more than enough time for Samuel to raise his sons before becoming a travelling judge.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Was Samuel an absentee father? This is unclear. What is more clear is that there is no metion of Samuel taking any action of his sons, not even the weak warning that Eli gave.  This leaves either absenteism or the inability to discipline his sons that is the potential cause of his failure as a father.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Themes</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In chapter 8, the people demand a king.  The reponse from Samuel is to warn the Isrealis that a king means hardship - the king will take their children, their crops, levy taxes, demand forced labor, and make you his slaves.  The people respond "There must be a king over us." The Isrealites are begging for discipline.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The theme of disobedient and selfish sons continues with Jonathon, son of Saul.  Saul has the opportunity to make him pay for his disobedience and fails. Then Saul is disobedient to the Lord, opening the door for David to be annointed king. This theme continues until Solomon, worst father of them all, leaves his kingdom to his son who almost immediately splits the kingdom permanently.
