				<h2>Preface Dialog</h2>				
				<p>
					The Lord be with you.  <b>And with your spirit.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Lift up your hearts.  <b>We lift them up to the lord.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. <b>It is right and just.</b>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Preface</h2>				
				<p>
					It is truly right to give you thanks, truly just to give you glory, Father, most holy, for you are the one God living and true, existing before all ages and abiding for all eternity, dwelling in unapproachable light; yet you, who alone are good, the source of life, have made all that is, so that you might fill your creatures with blessings and bring joy to many of them by the glory of your light. And so, in your presence are countless hosts of Angels, who serve you day and night and, gazing upon the glory of your face, glorify you without ceasing. With them we, too, confess your name in exultation, giving voice to every creature under heaven as we acclaim:
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Holy</h2>				
				<p>
					<b>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
					Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
					Hosanna in the highest.
					Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
					Hosanna in the highest.</b>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Thanksgiving</h2>				
				<p>
					We give you praise, Father most holy, for you are great, and you have fashioned all your works in wisdom and in love. You formed man in your own image and entrusted the whole world to his care, so that in serving you alone, the Creator, he might have dominion over all creatures.
</p><p>
And when through disobedience he had lost your friendship, you did not abandon him to the domain of death. For you came in mercy to the aid of all, so that those who seek might find you. Time and again you offered them covenants and through the prophets taught them to look forward to salvation.
</p><p>
And you so loved the world, Father most holy, that in the fullness of time you sent your Only Begotten Son to be our Savior. Made incarnate by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, he shared our human nature in all things but sin. To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation, to prisoners, freedom, and to the sorrowful of heart, joy.
</p><p>
To accomplish your plan, he gave himself up to death, and, rising from the dead, he destroyed death and restored life. And that we might live no longer for ourselves but for him who died and rose again for us, he sent the Holy Spirit from you, Father, as the first fruits for those who believe, so that, bringing to perfection his work in the world, he might sanctify creation to the full.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Request</h2>				
				<p>
					Therefore, O Lord, we pray: may this same Holy Spirit graciously sanctify these offerings, that they may become the Body + and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ for the celebration of this great mystery, which he himself left us as an eternal covenant.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>The Eucharist Miracle</h2>				
				<p>
				For when the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, Father most holy, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end: and while they were at supper, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,
				</p><p>
				<i>Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you.</i>
				</p><p>
				In a similar way, taking the chalice filled with the fruit of the vine, he gave thanks, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:
				</p><p>
				<i>Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Do this in memory of me.</i>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>The mystery of our faith</h2>				
				<p>
					<b>We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup, we proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Save us, Savior of the world, for by your Cross and resurrection you have set us free.</b>
				</p>				
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>We remember</h2>				
				<p>
					Therefore, O Lord, as we now celebrate the memorial of our redemption, we remember Christâ€™s death and his descent to the realm of the dead; we proclaim his Resurrection and his Ascension to your right hand; and as we await his coming in glory, we offer you his Body and Blood, the sacrifice acceptable to you which brings salvation to the whole world.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>We call to the Holy Spirit</h2>				
				<p>
					Look, O Lord, upon the Sacrifice which you yourself have provided for your Church, and grant in your loving kindness to all who partake of this one Bread and one Chalice that, gathered into one body by the Holy Spirit, they may truly become a living sacrifice in Christ to the praise of your glory.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div>
				<h2>Intercessions</h2>				
				<p>
					Therefore, Lord, remember now all for whom we make this sacrifice: especially your servant, N. our Pope, N. our Bishop, and the whole Order of Bishops, all the clergy, those who take part in this offering, those gathered here before you, your entire people, and all who seek you with a sincere heart.
</p><p>
Remember also those who have died in the peace of your Christ and all the dead, whose faith you alone have known. To all of us, your children, grant, O merciful Father, that we may enter into a heavenly inheritance with the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her Spouse,* and with your Apostles and Saints in your kingdom. There, with the whole of creation, freed from the corruption of sin and death, may we glorify you through Christ our Lord, through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div>
				<h2>We Praise You</h2>				
				<p>
					Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, for ever and ever.
				</p>
				<p>
					Amen.
