				Mass is the perfect prayer.  Your prayers are taken to the alter where the sacrifice of Jesus is made present to us. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Mass deserves the same preparation and focus that players take through the tunnel as they walk onto the field for the national championship bowl game.  What can go wrong?  Be ready.

				The most likely things that can go wrong are a bad sound system, a speaker with an incomprehensible accent, and your own inability to maintain concentration and focus. If you're brave enough to open the book in the pew, in this time of infectious diseases, it's a struggle finding what you need in time. When mass was in Latin and the priest had their back to them, people took their missals.  This is my online missal.

				The readings are found on the <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/">USCCB website</a>.

				The most common Eucharistic prayers and other prayers are on this page.  Mexican prayers are included for bilingual masses.
