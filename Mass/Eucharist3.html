					The Lord be with you.  <b>And with your spirit.</b>

				<h2>Preface</h2>				
				<p>
					<i>Varies by season.</i>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Holy</h2>				
				<p>
					<b>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
					Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
					Hosanna in the highest.
					Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
					Hosanna in the highest.</b>
				</p>

				<h2>Thanksgiving</h2>				
				<p>
					You are indeed Holy, O Lord, and all you have created rightly gives you praise, for through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, by the power and working of the Holy Spirit, you give life to all things and make them holy, and you never cease to gather a people to yourself, so that from the rising of the sun to its setting a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Request</h2>				
				<p>
					Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you: by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the Body and + Blood of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>The Eucharist Miracle</h2>				
				<p>
				For on the night he was betrayed he himself took bread, and giving you thanks he said the blessing, broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying:
				</p><p>
				<i>Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you.</i>
				</p><p>
				In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:
				</p><p>
				<i>Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Do this in memory of me.</i>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>The mystery of our faith</h2>				
				<p>
					<b>We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup, we proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Save us, Savior of the world, for by your Cross and resurrection you have set us free.</b>
				</p>				
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>We remember</h2>				
				<p>
					Therefore, O Lord, we celebrate the memorial of the saving Passion of your Son, his wondrous Resurrection and Ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>We call to the Holy Spirit</h2>				
				<p>
					Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church, and, recognizing the sacrificial Victim by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, grant that we, who are nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one body, one spirit in Christ.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div>
				<h2>Intercessions</h2>				
				<p>
May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her Spouse,* with your blessed Apostles and glorious Martyrs (with Saint N.: the Saint of the day or Patron Saint) and with all the Saints, on whose constant intercession in your presence we rely for unfailing help.
</p><p>
May this Sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and salvation of all the world. Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim Church on earth, with your servant N. our Pope and N. our Bishop, the Order of Bishops, all the clergy, and the entire people you have gained for your own. Listen graciously to the prayers of this family, whom you have summoned before you: in your compassion, O merciful Father, gather to yourself all your children scattered throughout the world.
</p><p>
† To our departed brothers and sisters and to all who were pleasing to you at their passing from this life, give kind admittance to your kingdom. There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory through Christ our Lord through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. †

				<h2>We Praise You</h2>				
				<p>
					Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, for ever and ever.
				</p>
				<p>
					Amen.
