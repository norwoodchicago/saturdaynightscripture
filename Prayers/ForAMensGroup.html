	<p class="sj-litany">
	<b class="sj-begin">Jesus,</b> 
	you created a team called the 12.  You picked the 72.  You fed the 4,000 and the 5,000.  You sent them out 2 by 2.
	</p>		
</div>	

<div class="sj-prayer">
	<p class="sj-litany">
	<b class="sj-begin">Our church is abandonded and it is getting worse.</b> Not to complain, but the work list is growing. The baby boom left us ungrounded in faith - <i>seems right and feels good</i> passes for ethical reasoning. 95% of the graduates of our Catholic schools stopped going to church. Parents seemed surprised that I would bother to ask about this, like it doesn't matter. Our inner city churches are museums to efforts of the past, and now sit empty like boat anchors instead of boats.

<div class="sj-prayer">
	<p class="sj-litany">
	<b class="sj-begin">Jesus,</b> 
	I don't even know what my prayer is. This isn't aboat in the storm, this is me alone in the water holding a piece of it. Jesus I trust in you. Even now.
	</p>		
</div>	

<div class="sj-prayer">
	<p class="sj-litany">
	<b class="sj-begin">Mary most holy, spouse of the Holy Spirit</b>, I'm praying as much as I can and I'm barely hanging on if not sliding backward.  I consider with grief what is happening to my brothers who gave up on our faith and just watch Netflix.  Please help.
	</p>		
</div>	

<div class="sj-prayer sjtitle sjtitle1">	
	<p class="sj-litany">		
	<b class="sj-begin">Paul</b>, you had your own community problems. You were abandonded once en route and then in the prison.  But you managed to get things together.  Saint Paul, please pray for us.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="sj-prayer sjtitle sjtitle2">	
	<p class="sj-litany">		
	<b class="sj-begin">Jean de Brebeuf</b>, you and your partners found yourself alone among thousands of violent demon worshipping people. The indians let you know that they didn't care at all about your theology, so you spent 3 years learning their language and customs. God put you there as a message to us. Saint Jean de Brebeuf and the North American maryrs, pray for us.
	</p>

<div class="sj-prayer sjtitle sjtitle3">	

<p class="sj-litany">
	<p class="sj-litany">		
	<b class="sj-begin">Faustina Kowalska</b>, you complained repeatedly directly to Jesus about your worries, ineptitude, lack of ability, and the fact that you had to go it alone. You mentioned how your superiors and confessors would say the wrong thing and set you back on your path. And you mentioned them directly to Jesus who was there in the room. He finally gave you Father Sopoko. Saint Faustina, pray for us.
	</p>

<div class="sj-prayer sjtitle sjtitle3">	
<p class="sj-litany">
	<p class="sj-litany">		
	<b class="sj-begin">Also Faustina</b>, remember when you complained to Saint Ignacious in prayer that you feel like the saints aren't pulling their weight by helping out? He appeared to you to present his side of the argument. Well, I need help too. Saint Faustina, pray for us twice.
	</p>
</p>
</div>
			
<div class="sj-prayer sjtitle sjtitle4">	
	<p class="sj-litany">		
	<b class="sj-begin">Padre Pio</b>, when the villiagers found out your order was going to transfer you somewhere else, they formed a mob to stop it. I didn't think of this option until <i>after</i> our diocese lost its evangalist.  Now what?  Padre Pio, pray for us.
	</p>
</div>			
			
<div class="sj-prayer sjtitle sjtitle5">	
	<p class="sj-litany">		
	<b class="sj-begin">Monica</b>, when you started out your mission to pray for the conversion of your son, you were a rotten incompetent Christian living among mean, sinful, rotten pagans who had no respect for your religion.  Guess what I am?  Saint Monica, pray for us.
	</p>
</div>
			
<div class="sj-prayer sjtitle sjtitle6">	
	<p class="sj-litany">		
	<b class="sj-begin">Bishop John Baptist Wang Jin</b>, you lost your entire flock and were put into prison by the communists. The only thing you could do as a Christian shepard is turn toward another country that had the Blessed Sacrament and adore the Eucharist as best you could from solitary confinement for <i>twenty years</i>. We didn't need the communists to surpress Catholism; we just walked away of our own accord. Bishop in John Baptist Wang Jin, pray for us.
	</p>
</div>
			
<div class="sj-prayer sjtitle sjtitle7">	
	<p class="sj-litany">		
	<b class="sj-begin">Augustine Number 2</b>, Gregory sent you to Britian to convert the pagans. You wrote back for advice, not really sure how to proceed with such this brand new challenge. Gregory responded. Our country is slowly coming to the realization that our challenge is unprecidented and we can't just go back to the way things were. Consider this my letter to you asking for guidance. Saint Augustine of Canterbury, pray for us.
	</p>
</div>					
			
			
<div class="sj-prayer">	
<p class="sj-litany">	
	<b class="sj-begin">Vince Capodano</b>, you spent 18 hours a day taking helicopters across fighting zones in Viet Nam to say mass and hear endless hours of confessions to a group that probably needed it the most. You need a miricle to become a saint and our parish is in desperate need of a men's group - which I'll be honest looks like a lost cause. Servant of God Vincent Capodano, pray for us.
</p>

<div class="sj-prayer">
	<p class="sj-litany">
	<b class="sj-begin">Father in Heaven</b> 
	I admit that this is our fault and we have turned away from eachother in turning away from your Church. We deserve nothing. But your son Jesus died on the cross for us, and if we don't deserve it, he absolutely won mercy and graces for us on the cross.  I beg of you, because Jesus died on the cross, grant the grace of a men's group out of the goodness of your mercy because of Jesus.
