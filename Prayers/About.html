				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">FAQ about these prayers</h1>
				<p class="lead">TLDR: they work so say them.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>What are <i>these</i> prayers?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Prayer is a conversation between you and God.  Just as there are different types of conversations you can have with a friend, with someone on the street, with a co-worker, with a family member, prayer has many forms.  This page has the daily prayer, which is its own thing, and only <b>one other type</b> of prayer, the daily prayers of desperation.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				Prayers of desperation are useful in four situations.  The first is when your car breaks down on the train crossing. You've neglected maintenance your whole life, the electic door lock is broken because you spilled your beer on the door while drinking and driving last night. The train is coming quickly. The second scenario is a friend or family member borrowed this unfortunate car and now sits there on the tracks; and it's your fault.  The third scenario is that someone else is the person you used to be, there on the tracks with their poorly maintained car.  The fourth scenario is the Monica scenario covered below.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				It's hard enough being in a tough situation and having to write your own prayer. The best prayer of all is the words "God help me!" cried out by one of strong faith.  Technically speaking, if one had strong faith, one wouldn't really be in a 'desperation' situation.  There is more to these prayers than just someone else's wordy version of 'help'.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Is there such a thinig as a bad prayer?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">Prayer is a conversation between you and God.  You have zero going for you and zero to contribute to this conversation, and God is infinitely loving and merciful.  Under these conditions, you're not even the one who started the conversation.  Youi're probably just a late entry into this diaglogue, finally.  Compared to infinite, I'm don't think there is a measurable difference between the world's best prayer and the world's worst prayer in God's estimation.  The ration of 1 over infinity is the same as the ration of 1,0000,000 over infinity.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The topic of the prayer is really important, however.  If your topic is the Lotto, you're basically asking for God to replace his role in your life with a big check; that way you don't have to pray to God for you're daily bread or anything for that matter.  This type of a prayer prolongs the process if the process of prayer requires you to be open to God and the things of God. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				A prayer for Mercy, on the other hand, is answered immediately.  When you ask for a glass of mercy, you may get a bucket or a shower.  If you ask for mercy on everyone, it may be a deluge that makes Noah's flood look like a light rain.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Do they work?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">Yes, in spectacular ways, guaranteed...</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">...but terms and conditions apply.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">You may not notice the prayer succeeded.  You may never even know.  God may decide to answer your prayer request <i>for someone else</i> in honor of his glory which you will share in after you die.  He may hear your prayer and think, <i>that's such a great idea I'll start a national movement that answers this prayer for the requestor's entire country</i>, which will take approximately 20 years to complete.  He may fix your prayer over time into something more worthy of his love and mercy.  He may grant you what you should have asked for in the first place.  He may be more concerned about fixing the huge problem in your life that you are blind to.  He may reduce your anxiety because you're praying for something that he grants to everyone anyway.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Or he may just help you with your request because you need his help and you asked for it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Why involve saints?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				God is the God of the living, not the dead.  The difference between people on earth and people in heaven is that heaven people can see the face of God and living people can't.  As Christians, we are not expected to succeed alone.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>What is the Monica prayer?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The Monica prayer is certainly in the category of <b>Monica prayers</b>.  When you're encouraging someone to change, but you are blind to the fact that you are worse and need change just as much, and this person is horrified because they see the truth and you don't.  It's a losing battle.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				I'm not saying Monica didn't start her Christian journey with no gifts.  She had some powerful gifts, like her faith and her inability to give up.  What I'm saying is more important that this, that <i>Monica had some serious flaws and started her journey in a really bad situation</i>.  The main message is far more important than her eventual perfection as a saint. The main message is that she sucked as bad as you do, and her overall situation was a desperate as yours.  Think about that when you ask her for help.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				When you ask God "Please convert that person", God translates this to "God please convert me so that this other person can be converted", which is longer, more complicated process.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				As a mom and a Christian, Monica was a horrible monster.  She drove away her son's beloved partner and son <i>in the process of her futile efforts to convert him to Christianity.</i>  He associated this thing Christianity with the Christian trying to convert him, which is a valid association, and was horrified.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Monica's long and relentless process of praying for Augustine's conversion was not an act of strong faith and sainthood. It was an act of a rotten person turning to God for help.  She's good now in the end, but it took her 17 long years of praying to get there. There are important lessons lost in this story when we view it from the end. It is better viewed from the beginning where the world's worst person set out on a quest to pray, because this is where you are now, and she's already been through it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Every single prayer you say has an element of the Monica prayer.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>
				Were all the saints on your list rotten people?
				</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				TLDR: Hell yeah they were.  I'll hightlight some of the more recent saints.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Faustina catalogued in her diary what a miserable talentless bad person she was repeatedly, and her fellow nuns went on record to state that this was their impression as well. We can confidentally say that the historical record is unanimous that this was easly one of the top 5 worst Christians in modern history. The world's worst movie on Saints, considered a national tradgedy by Poland, was Love and Mercy (2019). Kamila Kaminska was cast as the heroic saint.  They should have cast Joan Kusack.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				At the end of his life, Padre Pio broke down on his death bed sobbing about all of his past sins.  This is the dude who had the stigmata and could bilocate (meaning he could be praying in the chapel and be phyically present at someone's beside on the other side of the country at the same time). One of the holiest people in the 20th century, with the clearest view of God, summed up his whole life as sin and regret of sin. Are you going to argue with him?  While books and movies of our greatest 20th century saints have been condescending train wrecks across the board, as is the 2022 Padre Pio movie, the one thing they did right was cast Shia LaBeuf.

				<p class="sj-litany">
				Mother Teresa spent TWENTY YEARS as the head mistress of a high income bording school for spoiled kids in the amidst of horrible poverty of Kolkata.  Next time you think your conversion is not progressing quickly, pray to her for help.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">John Paul II was the pope during the worst scandal filled decades and the most spectacular decline and failure of the Catholic church in history, especially in the west, but also in the east.  To add insult to injury, the absentee bishops were still denying the pedofile scandals but they found the time to promote to sainthood one of their own. As a saint, he has a unique perspective.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				These are my go-to saints for prayer. I don't just need help, I need help from someone who can appreciate from their own lives just what a screwed up mess I'm dealling with both internally and externally.
