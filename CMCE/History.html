				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">It's an awful time to be a Catholic in Chicago</h1>
				<p class="lead">And a great time if you like being useful.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>The setting</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Every organization reaches corruption by the 4th generation. The founder has a vision, the 2nd generation makes it work, and the 3rd generation expands rapidly.  The 4th generation runs the organization with entitlement as its own fifedom, going through the motions, repeating what was done in the past, and runs it into the ground.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				From the beginning of the 20th century, the church in Chicago couldn't open schools and churches fast enough to accomodate the waves of immigration - prepackaged Catholics of strong faith and determination. They fought against a anti-Catholic culture.  They designed churches to meet their needs. They opened schools to teach their children.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In this context, the church learned and exercised skills of bureacracy and administration. Historically, the church leadership trained priests and sent them to minister to Catholic communities. The diocese that I see is sadled with Catholic ghost towns.  
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Two changes exposed our weakness. First, demographics shifted from a steady stream of pre-packaged believers to people walking away. Second, this comprehensive ownership structure manifested its the mishandling of the sexual abuse crisis (think self preservation or arrogance) and the inability to change, adapt, or evangalize.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In three decades I've witnessed three different evangalization or renewal programs where nothing substantial changed and the church shrank significantly. I've heard complaints about demographics, a re-emphasis on doing what we've always done, some minor changes on top of the same self-preserving administrative structure.  
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Our church buildings are museums of past innovations to solve past problems.  Starting with stained glass windows and the intricate carvings in most parishes, I could give a tour of each church describing the time period and challenge that these solved.  There is even a rood in one of our local churches. One of our local churches is even arranged to look like a museum.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				When an organization faces change, about 58% do more of what they've always done, 39% do less than what they've always done, but just 3% do something different. In the Catholic context, these 3% are asking for maryrdom by the other 97%.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Before you start a rebellion read this</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				It turns out that the Chicago church leadership is the most innovative and fast moving church in the world.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The Chicago church had an early-ish and strong response the the sexual abuse crisis that became the model for the rest of the US church.  After that, they cleaned house at the seminary.  They have more deacons per statistic than any other church. They invented a social media evangalization that is now national but unfortunately not residing in Chicago currently. They created a model liturgy for the type of Catholic who would rather go to an evangelical mega-church. They banned the Latin mass based on its horrifying bad fruit. Finally, they are currently alienating complainy judgemental members who want to go back to 1950.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				What about all this whining about demographics?  Did Jesus or Paul complain about demographics? Yes. It appears that demographics is the number one complaint in the Gospels and New Testament letters.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The problem is not church leadership. The disconnect is that the church leadership is currently stuck with monolithic top-heavy organazation and a bunch of expensive to maintain church buildings designed for early 20th eastern europoean immigrants. They are shedding what they can.
				</p>

				<h2>My totally made up vision</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In my vision that I made up, I walked along the sea shore. The seas were very rough. In the distance I could see Pharaoh's whole army bearing down in their chariots. People were milling about oblivious to the pending catastrophe.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				I looked down and noticed a staff at my feet.  Where is our church leader, I wondered. "Where is our church leader?" I yelled. Jesus walked up. "Where is our church leader?" I asked "when we need him to pick up this staff so that God can part the sea." 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				"He's busy doing what I asked him to do," replied Jesus. Then he just staired at me like an El Greco painting.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				"Oh," I thought.  "Oooohhhhhhhhhhhhh." I bent down to pick up the staff. 
				Staff in hand, I started walking toward Pharaoh's army. It's not 1500 BC and I'm not a sea parting type of person. It's whackin' time. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				As the army approached, I could see not one army but many armies. Egyption chariots, Asyrians, Persians, Moabites, Romans, demons, Orcs and Storm Troopers. I turned back toward the beach and saw many more staffs lying in the sand. I looked at the people milling about and decided I'm holding a prodding staff instead of a whacking staff.
