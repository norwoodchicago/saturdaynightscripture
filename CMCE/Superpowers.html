				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">Superpowers</h1>
				<p class="lead">Eight distinuishing characteristics of a Catholic.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>From the Eucharist</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				We become more like Jesus from eating his body and blood. What does that mean? Go to a church, observe the tabernacle. Look with your eyes and listen with your ears when you receive the Eucharist. It's the real deal. Silent, invisible, small. These aren't really superpowers so much as a secret identy.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Jesus is also powerless. It's a shame that our theology lists God's attributes as all powerful, everywhere at once, all knowing, but doesn't mention all powerlessness. Look at the cross. Mercy has an element of powerlessness caused by free will. I'm not lising all-powerless as a superpower because the theology isn't there yet and it doesn't sound like a superpower.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				God is hidden and yet we can see him. We see him especially in the small and weak, outcasts, poor people, people with no social skills, the homebound and others.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Ability to take a beating</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Christians are famous for their super ability to take abuse.  The Indians of Northern New York and Quebec were ultimately converted by the heroic courage of the Jesuits in the face of torture over a period of months. The Iroquois ripped the heart out of John de Brebuef and drank his blood in the hopes of gaining his super stregth. They didn't have a firm grasp on Christian theology but they were in the ballpark.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The Catholic has a utility belt of these abilities. He can be told 'no' repeatedly, ridiculed, put off, ignored, yelled at, blamed, humiliated. Instead of being bullet proof, the Catholic just gets used to it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>X-ray vision</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Supposedly we have the ability to read people's hearts. This power is unlocked by having selfless love toward this person. I am not an expert on this superpower but read it once in an obscure message from Medjugorje.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Rip open locks</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				It's a bit frustrating to me that our churches are locked. It's like holding Jesus hostage. From a marketing perspective, it says 'Go away you're not wanted here'. On three separate occassions, in disappointment, I asked Jesus to open the door and gave the door a second yank. The door opened each time. On other occassions, this superpower failed me. The key to this superpower is how desparate you are for forgiveness and mercy.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				From a theological perspective, most of us including me don't technically have any special abilities like this other than to ask God by way of prayer. Also, churches tend to be old and their locks are a sloppy affair.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				But still, ripping open locks.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Rip open gates</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The church is more powerful than the gates of hell. "The gates of hell won't prevail against the church." Normally this is misinterpreted to mean that the church is powerful and will withstand challenges forever, but as you can see in many historical settings and many regions, the church can and is wiped out completely. This is happening today in Chicago.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				What this saying actually means is that I can walk up to the gates of hell, reach in, grab some soul, and yank them out. If needed, I could pick the lock. The church as a group could probably do a lot more damage. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There is a subtle nuance of 'gates of hell' that means 'the place where disputes are settled and judgements rendered'.  The hell of a final decision on the part of free will is not included; everything leading up to that is fair game.
				</p>
			</div>					
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Glow</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				In Matthew 6:22 Jesus promises the hearers that they will be able to glow, provided that they look on all things and all people with the purest love. There isn't any explanation of 6:22 or 6:23 that clarifies what the eyes have to do with it and why they are the key, so I assume that the key is looking on another with love or maybe with mercy.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If you stumble across an unfortunate person, and you think "I just found Jesus", the glow will blind people in all directions and there will be car accidents. If you stumble across an unfortunate person and think 'I going to say hi to this unfortunate person and maybe give them some money' you will briefly light up the world in a 3 foot radius.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				For those of us who aren't saints yet, the secret to using our feeble version of this superpower is to find someone that is so bad, in such a dark place, that your little glow is noticeable.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The Mercy Force</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				A full comparison of our faith and starwars is mostly about how things are different and not similar. For example, as a Catholic, if you open your hand to summon your light sabor from across the room, the spirit will tell you to get out of your chair and walk over and get it. You may trip and hurt yourself doing it.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				But not mercy. You're ability to forgive is infinite and comes directly from God. His mercy is invincible and therefore so is yours. Mercy is your most powerful weapon. It's the sword that breaks locks and chains. It's the shield to all those types of beatings I listed in the 'take a beating' section above. It's the super weapon, the bunker buster, the battering ram. It's the war to end all wars. It's putting your staff down on the bridge when you yell out 'You shall not pass'.
				</p>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Believing two things at once</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Almost every question in the Catholic faith have two answers that appear to be opposite. Many of our concepts are incompatable and contradictory, like true God and true Man, or grace, savation and free will. Jesus appointed our bishops to guide us in matters of doctrine and worship, but you can clearly read in the bible that they were inept and unqualified in every way.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				It's posslbe to take the time, maybe months, and reconcile two contradictory tennants of our faith, but for 95% of Catholics and 100% of non-Catholics, it appears that we are holding fast to yes and no or true and false at the same time. 
				</p>
			</div>								
				<h2>Seven superpowers</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Seven is a good stopping point. It's possible that there are 12, or just 5, or that the last 5 on my list above are really all just mercy. I count 9 from the list above, maybe 10. At the next Catholic men group meeting we'll spend a few minutes are arguing about what is missing or what should be excluded.
