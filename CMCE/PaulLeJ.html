				<p class="lead">God gave us Paul Le Jeune as a patron to lead the way</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Who was Paul Le Jeune?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Paul Le Jeune was one of the early Jesuits in New France (Quebec 1620's). He wasn't a martyr nor a saint. He just worked hard and did the best he could.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Paul Le Jeune was in charge of the Jesuit mission at Quebec when it was just a few people and they were trying to figure out how that thing is going to work. As the leader, he was required to write back to France a report of goings on. In his own words, he expresses his admiration and respect of the Indians, and how they are better in many ways than the French. He explains how the Jesuits can better understand, serve, and show respect for the Indians.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				He also calls them demon worshipping savages and has many unfortunate escapades that would make is writings suitable for an ironic weekly comedy if they weren't so tragic. As the superior of the mission, he throws obedience aside, puts someone in charge of the mission, and tromps off with the Indians to ulimately ruin their winter hunting season because they have to carry his sick self back to the mission at great peril to everyone. In another episode, while ministering to sick Indians he comments on how grateful that he is that the French aren't sick - from a sickness that he describes as nearly identical to European small pox. He tries to avoid the medicine man, but gets stuck in his tent for the winter, where they argue constantly on Indian verus Christian spirituality.

				This article is How to Evangalize Demon Worshipping Savages by Paul Le Jeune.

				<h2>Throw away everything you know</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The 16th and 17th century Jesuits were the most educated people in Europe, at the #1 universities of their day, to the tune of 11 to 14 years of college and graduate school. Unfortunately, the Indians didn't give a rats behind about their theology. Paul experienced this first hand. Later John de Brebeuf sent a famous letter back to France warning that the Indians judge a man by how far he can carry 100 pounds in the snow while half naked. In other words, how he can help with their migration during hunting season and not the nuances of theology.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				John and Paul made learning the language their first priority.  Paul worked for a few years making this possible, and John did the work. Thanks to them, we have a record of the language and wonderful customs. The point here is that their language was of critical importance, and the language of the Jesuits (French theology) was useless. John de B would later write beautiful songs in the Algonquin language.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				A note on the Indian customs. The Indians lived in long houses. Paul noted that in all the years he was there, not one Indian was observed complaining or protesting despite the many offenses that happen daily in such close quarters. According to Paul, four French people living in a 4 room apartment couldn't go an hour without bickering. When the Indian captains gathered to make decisions for the tribe, one might have been older and wiser but didn't have explicit authority. Instead, each would be given a turn to speak, and after he spoke, each of the others would say "I heard what you said". Contrast that with 'discussion' in congress or on reddit. Finally, John complained that it was impossible to teach Indian children without beatings, but the Indian parents forbid corporal punishment, maybe because primitive life was already punishing enough.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Bottom line your evangalization audience doesn't care what you have to say. You need to care what they have to say.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>There's a reason why they were called demon worshipping savages</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Each savage had a personal demon. One would go into the woods for a few days, and then return to announce that their demon says that tribe needs to go to war or do something horrible I'm not going to repeat. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There was no concept of God, nor great spirit, or the Great White buffalo, or even any words that the Jesuits could use to convey God. The modern Indian understanding of their spirituality that involves God the creater, or the great spirit or whatever you want to call it post dates the Jesuits and the Franciscans. It was really difficult for the Jesuits to find words for God when that concept did not exist in the Indian language. They finally settled on 'Great Captain in the Sky'.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The main problems that the Jesuits tried to solve were malnutrition and starvation because of the winter hunting migration versus an agriculture based way of life, the need to abandon the sick and old during migration or else the whole tribe will perish, constant wars, and their custom of torturing war prisoners as long as they could until the prisoner died of exposure. Later the Jesuits battled exploitation of the French and Dutch traders, brandy, and forced migration.

				<h2>Wouldn't it be great if one side was bad and one side was good</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				Seventeenth century North America was made up of players both good and bad. If you're looking for villians, you can put the whole group up for nomination. Same thing for heros. Ultimately these Indian tribes adopted the Catholic faith and put a church in the center of their villiage, not because they were unintelligent or oppressed, but because the Jesuits walked with them, spoke to them in their language, and ultimately joined with them in wars, plague, famine and the trail of tears.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				The Indians of Quebec and northern New York adopted the Catholic faith not because God made them powerful and winners and politically lottery, but because the Holy Spirit brought them the church Jesus founded; evidence includes calamity, moving, plague and losing everything. Jesus didn't promise the early church political success and power - he promised them the opposite. 
				</p>
			</div>	
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>They wore black robes</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				No one was confused about whether or not the Jesuits were Catholics.  The Indians called them 'Black Robes'.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				The Jesuits also cared for the sick, retrieved the abandoned, protested the treatment of prisoners and instituted prisoner exchanges, saved corn for the winter, prayed before the hunt, and buried baptized Christians in separate grave yards.
				</p>
			</div>				
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The bottom line</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				Evangalization according to the North American martyrs means letting your demon worshipping neighbors know you are Catholic and waiting for the plague.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				In between these two events, learn their language and try to be useful.
