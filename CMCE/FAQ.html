			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Why start a men's group in Chicago?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are 2 reasons.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				First, it's nice for Catholic men to get semi-organized and support eachother in our missions and faith. At least we should learn eachother's names and meet periodically. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Second, it's like a back door back to the faith. It's a lot easier to talk to a friend or neighbor about a Catholic men's group than it is to start out with how Jesus is my best friend how about coming to back to mass after a 20 year hiatus. More on this topic below.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				</p>				
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>What does this group do?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					It meets, periodically.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>And?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Right now our meetings are more like jeapordy. Pick a category, pick a question, and see where it goes. But since the only reason right now for the existance of the group, we might want to talk about inviting our former Catholic friends and come up with some content that might be relevant to them.
				</p>
			</div>					
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>How does one start a men's group?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are men's group's popping up across the country. The founders report that if you ask a man to join a men's group, the answer is probably no. If you invite someone to a worthwhile program, the answer may be yes.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There's no hurry to get this program off the ground, but a public invite with a relevant topic or speaker can bring back men to a setting that might be more comfortable than the church building.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>What's the outlook for the diocese?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Our church in Chicago is shrinking out of existance. We've lost 57% of mass goers since 1990 according to the archdiocese annual report. 88% of people in Chicago who identify as Catholic don't attend mass. Based on research by Stephen Bullivant, Pew and others, it's going to get much worse, because the 88% isn't raising Catholics, and the 12% is pretty old.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Almost half of our parishes have closed since 1990. We're down to 221, and 127 of these have less than 1,000 attending mass.  Based on trends and surveys, these 127 will likely close under a business as usual scenario.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Since 1990, we've had 3 diocese wide renewal programs followed by 3 periods of decline. During the last renewal program, my parish group decided that our problem was that we stopped doing what we used to do when the parish was thriving. The resulting effort failed miserably. 
				</p>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Does this group have an evangalization plan?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				No, but getting together periodically to discuss topics related to the faith is a good first step.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>What about "preach always, but use words when necessary?"</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				This statement is frequently attributed to St. Francis. Fransican historians have no evidence that he ever said this, but written evidence that asked diocesean bishops if his Friars could preach in their town squares. Like Jesus himself, it appears that Saint Francis was a proponent of preaching.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				One way to look at this statement is to acknowledge that preaching the gospel doesn't have credibility if you aren't living the gospel. This is the intent of people who misquote Francis.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Ignacio Larranaga (Brother Francis of Assis, 1994) gives a careful treatment of his history. Francis doesn't preach as in "this is what Jesus said and this is what Jesus did" or "this is what the church says", but opens doors by discussing the elements of faith that point in the right direction.  In the case of Francis, he preached poverty or humility. Francis would open a door that his listeners didn't see before.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In the same way, when I use the term Catholic Men's Group in conversation, I just opened a back door that was previously hidden.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Is this group associated with a parish?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				No. A parish group is a good thing. That's why we have so many of them. We have many women's groups and many women's and men's groups that do all sorts of activies and missions. What we don't have is growth, and the highest risk category is men.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Is this group against the church?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Jesus selected bishops and annointed them with the Holy Spirit to guide us in matters of doctrine and worship. The west has traditionally fought against bishops both on matters of doctrine and how to worship. This Catholic men's group is Catholic in the sense of "let the bishops do their role and we'll worry about our share of the other 95%". The other 95% is a big enough task. The other 95% won't be completed before we die. Somewhere in that 95% is a mission for this team.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				As a side note, 99% of Catholics and 100% of non-Catholics in Edgewater that I have personally spoken to have a problem with the church. A Catholic men's can put forward a window into the church that is different than the legal, public face of the chuch.
				</p>
			</div>
	
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Why aren't women invited</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					The church has many problems and many types of ways to service. I've picked a very specific one. From my current experience, we don't have a women problem, we have a men problem. Specifically, I want to invite my peers back to the church and don't feel qualified to mansplain our church to a woman at this time.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					From my very limited market research, brining up the topic of a men's group to a woman in liberal Edgewater is worse than discussing politics and religion. If anyone is looking for additional penance during Lent, I suggest talking to a woman about the men's group.
				</p>
			</div>							
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>What are the categories of discussion at these periodic meetings?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Things people bring up, what we can do for our parish, good atheist questions, good former-Catholic questions, how to fix our diocese, how to fix our church, how to evangalize without evangalizing, any other problem that we can at least begin defining, and the big issues standing in the way between my neighbors and the Catholic faith.
