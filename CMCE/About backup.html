				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">Catholic Men Chicago Edgewater</h1>
				<p class="lead">It's many things.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>For starters, you tell me</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If you're a Catholic man in Chicago and want to know what a Catholic men's organization is, I hope to meet you, or talk to you, or correspond with you so I can ask you what it should be.  A Catholic men's organization is what the Catholic men in the organization decide it is.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p>
				If on the other hand, if you've given up on the Catholic church, or you are a Protestant, atheist, agnostic, lukewarm Catholic, or Catholic dad trying to get his act together so he can convert his pagan kids to the faith, I'll share my thoughts about what this organization could be.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>What it is</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The official mission of a Catholic men's organization is for men to support eachother in their quest for holiness, growing closer to Jesus and fulfilling their unique misssion or role in salvation history.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				That's like telling a marine recruit in 1943 that his job is to &quot&support and defend the Constitution of the United States &quot&. This is 100% true, but a bit vauge given it's 1943 and there are 2 wars going on across the globe on the land, sea and air.  
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>What it could be</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In Genesis 2, before God created Eve, God told Adam to go to work in the garden, gave him a single rule to break, and assigned him an additional task to name things.  Therefore a man's job is to work, break rules, and someday mansplain to Eve what all the made up animal names are.  I'm going to focus on the work aspect.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				A man shows up to work in order to work.  If there's no job do to, he needs to find work somewhere else.  If the task is already done, he needs to find another taks. If the manager tells him he doesn't trust the man or is contemptuous of the man's skills, the man has some very difficult choices to make before work begins. If the man shows up for a team effort, and other team members are 7 Filipino grandmothers saying the rosary, he has a much bigger job to do than expected.  
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There's so many jobs unfulfilled right now, so much work to be done.  Are these ordinary jobs like planting seeds in a hoed row?  No, these are more complicated jobs like fixing the tiller and water drainage.  These are problem solving jobs, innovative, inventive, and unprecedented.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">When I was a teen, I spent many hours on the farm in the hot sun getting covered with mud and chaff while the farmer fixed, solved, assessed and made the farm run despite and endless series of financial and environmental catastrophes, plus me driving the tractor over baby corn plants because I was so bad at steering.  I'm not a teen anymore.  Time for big boy work.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Ponderings on problems to solve</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				From the time I moved to Chicago until now, 95% of Catholics have abandoned the church or moved, or both.  There are 3 points when the entire family gives up on the faith - after 2nd grade, after confirmation, and moving from a Catholic grade school to a public high school.  COVID ended it for most of the rest.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Jesus selected our bishops and annointed them in the Spirit to guide us on doctrine and worship.  The left has rebelled against doctrine and the right is rebelling against worship.  Who thinks they know more than the bishop that Jesus selected and annointed on matters of doctrine and worship?  Apparently everyone. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Let's get back to our kids.  Say I get my kids an hour a day.  The other 11 hours are taken by the public schools, libraries, drug dispensories, web porn sites and chat rooms, all of which are in all out war against God.  
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				This doesn't bother me as much as the 10 meetings I had with 10 pastors asking for a mass suitable for kids.  Since the Catholic schools probably have a mass for kids during the week, Catholic school families didn't attend mass so the only masses we had were suitable for old ladies.  None of these meetings went well. It's not just that I didn't get what I wanted, it's my reaction when I was told by a Catholic priest that it's OK for kids to leave the Catholic church.  At the time I was a bit hot headed and there may have been anger and swearing involved on my part. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Within 3 blocks of my church are a theater showing a pro abortion play, a palm reading shop, and an abortion clinic. I wonder if anyone knows.  
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Over the last 400 years or so, there have been prophecies that Catholics will be silent.  One Saint had a vision that people would be silent in Church, not looking or speaking to their fellow church goers.  I've seen the same people at mass in sparsly attended masses for 20 years or more and have never talked to them.  Could be autism at work.  Or it could be something else. Regardless, I don't ever talk to Catholic men on any topics ever.  I feel like the last Catholic in Chicago.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Early in the COVID crisis, I was sitting at home watching Netflix and drinking a beer in lieu of going to mass, which was forbidden.  Wouldn't it be great if I had something to do instead, once a week, that involved other human beings.  What did Christian men do in other eras?  In the AD 50's, they were crucified.  In the AD 200's, they were fed to the lions and burned.  In 17th century Japan, hung upside down until death. In 1940's Poland, Catholic men were sent to Auswitz. In Nicaragua today, you're exiled.  And here I am in 2021 watching Netflix and wondering if I need a new pair of walking shoes.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are many things that can to be said about our church leadership, but after 20 years of research, the most important thing to say is that they are our guide in all things doctrine and worship.  Therefore, if you see something else that needs to be done, don't blame them, don't ask them, and don't tell them.  Just do it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Today in Chicago there are numerous problems with the poor, drug addicts, alcolholics, Venuzelans who got here last week, homeless people, and people smoking on the El.  I assume as a Christian you have to do something in this space as a non-negotiable.  There are 30 very heroic, well organized Catholic women in my neighborhood who are a tour de force.  I help them when I can, but mainly I look for something else to do, like making sure there are Catholics in 40 years.
