				<p class="lead">And the only joy in your life.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>This would have been nice to know when I was in my 20's</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				After the flood, God told humans to go forth and multiply.  This wasn't just a common sense suggestion to address a unique situation.  This is our creator telling us why he created us.  To be blunt, for almost all of humanity, the only joy you will experience on earth is the joy of being a parent to your own children.
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are hundreds of reasons why many of us didn't quite make it to a family of 7 kids.  The most common reason is that by the time we find out the only truely valuable thing in our lives is our kids, it's pretty late in the game. Other reasons include sin, tradgedy, and in rare cases conciously giving this up in order to serve the lord.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Before I provide an argument for this, let me point out that there is another source of joy. The other source of joy is suffering. You can suffer in many ways including service, sacrifice, humiliations, loss, or prayer. There is good news, therefore, for those who missed the first opportunity, although this is weighed down by lots of irony.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Suffering because you're far away from God or make decisions contrary to his will for you or because of this world of sin that we live in does not result in joy.  It's just suffering.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Objections</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Discussing this topic is as painful as discussing the Church's rules on divorce and remarriage. By the time you are ready to practice your faith seriously, you've already been divorced and remarried. Again, it's pretty late in the game to tell me now. It seems unfair.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				On both of these topics there is ultimately good news - Jesus died for your sins on the cross and his mercy is invincible compared to your sin.  The purpose of this article is to discuss the objections that are preventing many people from letting go of their own sin that they cling to and accepting what God wants for you, which is better.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The rest of this article is discussing objections.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">  
				<h2>#1 It's not possible for me to be wrong</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The number one response to a moral rule is also the number one flaw in human decision making.  Speaking of pride, I pride myself on taking an argument against our faith and making an even better argument. Here it is:  &quot;Doesn't Jesus accept me as I am?&quot;
				</p>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Definately not. Jesus accepts you unconditionally, but the &quot;as I am&quot; part goes in a dumpster so he can replace it with &quot;as he wants you to be&quot; which is way better. Please take some time to look at each and every person he talked to in the bible. They either rejected him or were freed, healed, released, changed. For example, take my personal favorite, the man in the tombs cutting himself and being possessed.  After a meeting with Jesus, he does not live in the tombs, he is not possessed, he is not cutting himself and breaking chains.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Another version of this argument boils down to &quot;sin doesn't exist.&quot; Sin doesn't care if I think it exists or not, it is a path of destruction in my life and those around me. A more productive version is &quot;I am not morally responsible.&quot;  Yes, I did not lead the life that God wanted me to, but here I am now, reconverted, but I still have to pay a price for my uniformed decisions earlier in life.  I don't have the joy of 7 kids, and I can't receive the Eucharist because of my 2nd marriage, or I'm still in prison for the murder I committed.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">The man in the tomb still has scars from cutting himself and breaking chains. The man on the mat is carrying his mat at the end of the story. The woman at the well still has her messy situation. Mary Magdaline still has her messy past. Nichodemas still has his cowardice. All of these people weren't just changed to be perfect in the eyes of the world, they were changed to be perfect in the eyes of God. Maybe not perfect <i>yet</i>, but certainly better. Maybe more importantly, they were given a new purpose.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">The rich man of Mark 10/Matthew 19 deserves special mention because he was the one person who didn't approach Jesus to be fixed or healed.  The rich man approached Jesus to be told that he was right. Not only did he leave with nothing, he left sad. Above when I said that Jesus accepts you but the &quot;as you are&quot; needs to go in the dumpster, I meant it. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				And when I said the mercy of Jesus is invincible, I meant that too. Name the two people who were the only ones courageous enough to bury Jesus. Look at the gospel of John for the full answer. A rich man and a Pharasee. The two people who the Gospels present as the enemies of Jesus.
				</p>

				<h2>#2 Our bishops</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Would God give us a small group of leaders that dictate morality to the rest of us, especially on the topic of marriage and family in which they don't participate, and more importantly, does is this moral direction valid when they have a recent history of being corrupt, not living the faith, or just incompetent?
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				I realize that it's not fair to accuse someone of being human, sinful, or part of a larger group where one or more members might be downright evil. They could say the same thing about me and be right. Nonetheless...
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				God picking someone else to tell you what is right or wrong and 100% of the evidence supports this. In the Old Testament, Moses provided the entire law to the Jews. There is a scene where the Jews, stubborn and disgruntled as usual, demand that they are included in the face-to-face conversations with God. It didn't go well for them. In the New Testament, Jesus passed out healing and forgiveness freely, but chose specific peole to lead doctrine and worship. Paul was an exception, but he paid a very big price for his special role, and this price did not include wearing $3,000 sneakers. Both Jesus and later Paul outline who is qualified for what role, and the only people I know who pass these qualifications today are obedient to the church.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The person who argued that God himself was wrong and we should make our own choices was Satan, in the garden of Eden, and we're still paying the price for listening.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Is it possible for the Holy Spirit to come to a person who either is weak in some way, or subsequently commits an offensive act? Furthermore, will the Holy Spirit comes to this person so that this person can covey truths or guidance to the rest of us? In the context of the sexual abuse scandal, we witnessed not just evil, but bad judgement, coverup, ineptitude, and widespread sleeping at the wheel.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Again, the answer is yes. One of the 7 moral truths of the Old Testament, starring Jephthah in Judges 11, is that an evil act on the part of a moral leader does not negate the Spirit of God. The Gospels take pains to illustrate the many, many flaws of the bishops that Jesus chose in person. Peter is thoroughly wrong, faithless, inept, and unqualified. He led a group of bishops with no theological training. These are the people that Jesus chose and annointed with his Spirit to lead the rest of us, and every generation new leaders are annointed in the Holy Spirit to lead us on doctrine and worship.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Jesus selected our bishops and annointed them in the Spirit to guide us on doctrine and worship.  The left has rebelled against doctrine and the right is rebelling against worship.  Who thinks they know more than the bishop that Jesus selected and annointed on matters of doctrine and worship?  Apparently everyone. 
				</p>

			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Faith not works, Mercy not rules</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				When it comes to turning your back on God and trashing his law, the Prodical son is the go to story. Yet God welcomed back the Prodigal son in an extraordinary Godlike display of mercy. You also get to see faith in action as the Prodigal son returned home.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Will God undo the damage? The Prodigal son wasted his inheritence, squandered his leadership role. His wife and kids don't exist, and when he finally gets around to having his own family, they'll live in a small shack bordering the half of a farm left to the family name that his jerk brother owns. When the Philistines attack next spring as they ususally do, the whole village is half as strong.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Revisit the rules</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				 God created each of us to join him in creation. We work on the important, lasting side of creation - the creation of humans, followed by developing them in the family context. Women have the big role, obviously, and men are either servants or leaders depending on what they want to call the role they play.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If you follow God consistenly in humility and trust, you will be rewareded many times over. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If you turn your back on God and go your own way, you will experience the effects of sin either as a lack of the great things he wanted to give you, or the destruction of those things that he did give you. Marriage, family, children. These are the only important things in life and the only permanent things in eternity for almost all people. If you look back on your life and see a life of service and sacrifice, then you may be in the small percentage that has a different calling. If you just got the memo and see that you live in a big house with a few kids, you can join me in reevaluating our values and seeing what we can do to get back on track.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The Catholic teachings on marriage, family and children are simply warning you what to avoid so that you don't wreak a path of destruction in your life and the lives of those around you. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The epilogue of my generation</h2>					
				<p class="sj-litany">
				I'm pondering two epilogues. In the first epilogue, we pick up our mat or leave the tomb and announce the good news to the next generation. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The other epilogue involves the Chastisement that is prophesized widely and on the way. What would this be, a meteor, plague or famine? The result of each scenario would be 5 or 6 children in each family of 7 die. 50% of kids remaining lose a parent. Families are broken up in the chaos. This is just a theory, but since we are already living under the result, is it possible that the Chastisement is upon us and God let us cause it ourselves?
