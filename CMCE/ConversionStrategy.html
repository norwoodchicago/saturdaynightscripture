				<h2>Introductory Premises and Assumptions</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				It's better to be part of the church than not be part of the church.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If someone walks into confession in a Catholic church, I am confident that their life will be 1000 times better walking out. Inside the confession, there is Jesus and the priest and the Holy Spirit talking into the priests ear.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If someone brings a mountain of sin into the confession, Jesus brings two mountains of mercy.
				</p>

				<h2>Reasons for leaving the church</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				No two people have the same reason for leaving the church. Putting an individual into a broad category mis-represents the discussion but allows me to write an article about it and organize my thoughts in terms of what to do next. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">Here's what I've learned so far</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Dislike of the church</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>There is no I in Team but there is an m and an e</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Over the last 126 years, disaffections from the church are associated with moving geographically or moving to a new way of thinking or way of life. Causality between going to college and leaving the church may depend on additional factors, like lack of faith or no adquate reason to have faith in the first place.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In 1635, a Jesuit missionary would take an ax in the face just to have 3 baptised converts. In 2014 I witnessed 90% of a first communion class ditch the Catholic church at the end of the program, parents and all. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				I have no solution right now for just walking away. I think this is what Jesus meant by 'lukewarm'. Not against the church, not trapped in evil, but don't see any value in it either.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The big three</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The big three sins show up in the garden of eden, at the temptation and condemnation of Jesus, and other places like Matthew 6:20(ish).
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Power, vanity or prestige or being right, and an indulgent lifestyle are all good reasons to stay away from the church. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There is a subtle nuance of 'gates of hell' that means 'the place where disputes are settled and judgements rendered'.  The hell of a final decision on the part of free will is not included; everything leading up to that is fair game.
				</p>
			</div>					
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Glow</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				In Matthew 6:22 Jesus promises the hearers that they will be able to glow, provided that they look on all things and all people with the purest love. There isn't any explanation of 6:22 or 6:23 that clarifies what the eyes have to do with it and why they are the key, so I assume that the key is looking on another with love or maybe with mercy.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If you stumble across an unfortunate person, and you think "I just found Jesus", the glow will blind people in all directions and there will be car accidents. If you stumble across an unfortunate person and think 'I going to say hi to this unfortunate person and maybe give them some money' you will briefly light up the world in a 3 foot radius.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				For those of us who aren't saints yet, the secret to using our feeble version of this superpower is to find someone that is so bad, in such a dark place, that your little glow is noticeable.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The Mercy Force</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				A full comparison of our faith and starwars is mostly about how things are different and not similar. For example, if you open your hand to summon your light sabor from across the room, the spirit will tell you to get out of your chair and walk over and get it. You may trip and hurt yourself doing it.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				But not mercy. You're ability to forgive is infinite and comes directly from God. His mercy is invincible and therefore so is yours. Mercy is your most powerful weapon. It's the sword that breaks locks and chains. It's the shield to all those types of beatings I listed in the 'take a beating' section above. It's the super weapon, the bunker buster, the battering ram. It's the war to end all wars. It's putting your staff down on the bridge when you yell out 'You shall not pass'.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">					
				I'm so fired up about Mercy I need to introduce the Mercy Sandwich in another article.
				</p>				
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Seven superpowers</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Seven is a good stopping point. It's possible that there are 12, or just 5, or that the last 5 on my list above are really all just mercy. At the next man group meeting we'll spend a few minutes are arguing about what is missing or what should be excluded.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				My nomination for Superpower #8 would be the ability to believe to contradictory truths at the same time. Something like 'Jesus is God and Jesus is Man' applies. This Superpower is up for additional discussion.
