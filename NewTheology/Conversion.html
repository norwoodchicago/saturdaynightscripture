				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">The Singular Role of Conversion</h1>
				<p class="lead">The only way to convert another is to convert yourself.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>My proposition</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Saint Francis is often misquoted as saying , "Preach always. Use words when necessary."
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				The life of Saint Francis was well documented within a few years of his life by those who were closest to him from the beginning. Historians know Saint Francis never said this. Instead, we have documentary evidence in the form of letters that Saint Francis sent to bishops across Europe asking for permission to have a friar preach in the town square. 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				This saying originated in a magazine article in the beginning of the twentieth century by a well meaning author. This saying has been quoted multiple times by priests in homilies (who were staring directly at me) to make the point that you don't need to judge people, at best, and if you correct their flaws and they see your own glaring flaws you will confuse them about the meaning of the gospel. In other words, you risk being a hypocrite.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				For 25 years, this saying has bothered me into silence as I pondered the fact that I'm the only Catholic left in Chicago that accepts the teachings of the bishops and the Holy Spirt and therefore have a personal mission to browbeat the rest of the church into agreement. Alas, winning arguments doesn't make converts. Nor do I consider converting already converted Christians much of a calling.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The answer lies in the life and writings of Saint Francis. In the same way that he promoted the incarnation, creaing a living creche for example, and a few centuries later the convoluted overly complicated writings of Duns Scotus demonstrated that the incarnation is the single most important event in human history, I'm going replace the saying above with a more acurate representation of Franciscan spirituality: the way to convert someone is to convert yourself. 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				To add to this theological principle, that you can only convert someone by converting yourself, I'll prove that this is the singular central theme of all of Fransican theology, and this this is the one and only priority for the Christian life in the decade beginning in 2024.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
			<h2>Counter arguments</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Conversion only happens by an act of will of the person being converted in response to the action of God who affects that conversion in the person's soul through grace. As Paul says, no one confesses that Jesus is Lord except through the Holy Spirit. This is probably the most serious challenge to my principle; it would appear that there is nothing you can do in the conversion space because it's all God and the other person.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				My first reaction to this contradiction is that our Catholic faith is full of paradoxical contradictions, like our Supreme God being humiliated, beaten, and killed by Roman authorities. I'm willing to live with this both/and scenario and move on. Paradoxes, however, always have a solution, if nothing more than acknowledging the limitations of our language.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				In this case, we're stuck with the directive from our God, saints, mystics, and our church to pray, sacrifice, and do penance for the conversion of others. Even if we play no role between the potential convertee and God, we are mandated to get in the game. The second argument below addresses this point.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				The next counter argument is that you are only converted to Christianity once, so how many people can you convert if this principle is true?  The third below argument addresses this point.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				What about priests or the North American martyrs or Adele of Door County who spent their lives in the service of others and who we can attribute many conversions? It appears that they spent a life in the service of our Lord and others to make their contribution, and not their personal conversion.  
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The definition of conversion</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				This argument is not going to get very far without a clear definition of conversion. When you first became serious about Jesus, whether at age 7 or 57, you had an important beginning conversion event. 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				What is the difference between yesterday and tomorrow in the life of a person who today confesses that Jesus is Lord and confesses his sins of gambling, drug abuse, pornography, oppressing the poor and explointing widows? Yesterday he was 100 miles from Jesus, and tomorrow he's a converted sinner who is 100 miles from Jesus and has a lot more conversion to do before he's all the way there. 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Even saints who are right next to Jesus, having no more flaws to convert, have daily opportunities to convert. Suppose every night you wake up at 3 am and say the divine mercy chaplet every day for 10 years. At no time are you the person who wants to kneel in your flimsy pajamas in the cold with a headache trying not to be distracted. As a human, you are the type of person who wants to stay in your warm bed and get some sleep so you are not crabby the next day. If you were OK with getting up every night, you can move on to holding your arms out like the cross, or singing the chaplet outloud, in both cases feeling stupid and humiliated that you are doing such. Each night is a new conversion experience. If not, we can move on to the next level closer to Jesus all the way up to bleeding from your hands and being unjustly executed.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				If you are unjustly executed in the service of others or for your faith, the Father looks at Jesus dying on the cross, then back at you. You have freely given up all potential conversion opportunities for the rest of your life and the Father will not be outdone by you. He's holding a plate with five loaves and two fish and I think I see a tear in his eye. But this is reserved for those within 2 feet of Jesus and we're still 100 miles away.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">  
				<h2>The importance of penance</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There is a trend this week of looking at the Psalms and realizing that Jesus not only took away our sins, but he took away our shame as well. Of course he did. All the people he healed were sent back to their communities and families to tell the what Jesus did, and they're going to have a hard time doing this with shame lingering in their hearts.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Saint Franics describes the opposite theme throughout the biography of Thomas of Celano. It's everywhere in his biography from beginning to end continuing even when he has the stigmta. Here are a few instances that come to mind:
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				<ul class="sj-litany">
					<li class="sj-litany">When he refers to himself as the son of Pietro di Bernardone, he is referring to himself as a selfish, vain, worldly playboy who is a sinner. He does this on multiple occassions, including after he received the stigmata. He uses the present tense.
					</li>
					<li>
					When he is asked what is true Joy, he responds that it is not converting every important person in Europe, but being mistreated and shunned and using that suffering opportunity to work out his own personal salvation.
					</li>
					<li>
					When he finally makes up for years of negligence in not visiting Clare's community, he walks there, walks in, reads Psalm 51 until everyone is sobbing, and leaves. (This is from Ignacio Laraganza's book on Saint Francis.)
					</li>
					<li>
					Francis didn't form the Third Order of Holy Lay People, he formed the Third Order of Lay Penitents. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				What is the difference between quietly feeling shame about the bad things that you did and openingly declaring how aweful of a sinner you used to be? One possibility is that a person who feels shame is not 100% responsible for the circumstanes that lead to a sinful life, and the person who feels penance knows they are no other people or circumstances to blame.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				A friend from Italy gave me some rough autobiographies of Padre Pio written shortly after his death. I was surprised to find that on his deathbed, after living 50 years with the stigmata, he sobbed outloud about all of his sins and then died. He didn't look up an announce that Mary was there to retrieve him. Just cried about his sins, babling to those present. More recent autobiographies santized or removed this content.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Likewise, Saint Faustina was so holy that Jesus visited her frequently. When she saw him, she complained that all she had to offer him was sin, misery, negligence, and lack of trust.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				All three of these stigmatists lived a life of penance and considered themselves sinful people. I can safely conclude with no more proof that penance, repentance, and conversion are a necessary part of the Christian life.
				</p>
				</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Argument number one</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Why all this conversion? How many conversion do you need before you are saved? The answer is one. You are saved upon your first conversion.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				When my protestant brothers whom I love ask me, "Why do you do all these works? You can't save yourself through works.", I respond, "Don't think these works are to save myself. I'm already saved. I do these works to save you from hell because you're an apostate and heritic who turned his back on the Eurcharist that Jesus himself gave us when he selected bishops and annointed them with the Holy Spirit to guide us in matters of doctrine and worship." Then a fist fight ensues.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">	
				I don't actually say this because a fist fight would ensue. I'd probably start it. But I think this, because it's true. I convert to convert others.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">					
				There is an old Eastern Orthodox fable about a woman in hell who is invited by an angel to hold on to an onion as he reels her in with a fishing pole on one end of the line, and the onion on the other. As people start grabbing her legs to also be pulled out of hell, she tries to shake them off and in the process the line breaks.  The point is that when you convert yourself, you convert others.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">	
				Argument number one is therefore a circular argument proving that the way to convert others is to convert yourself because that's the only way to convert others.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Argument number two</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				You're asking someone to do what you yourself refuse to do?
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Conversion is very challenging business. It's like scaling a frozen clift in a snowstorm. How convincing an argument can you make to another person to do something risking and hard that you yourself refuse to do? But wait, you think, I already scaled that clift and I'm assuring you that you can do it and it's a good idea.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				I wasn't there in the past and can't say for sure whether or not your past conversion is commensurate with the challenge you're asking me to do. I do see, and maybe you're blind to this, that you're staring at the next clift face in your own life and apparently refuse to acknowledge it, let alone risk it.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				In addition to the person I'm trying to convert, I wonder what God thinks when I pray for someone's conversion or talk to this person directly about their conversion but refuse the next step in my own conversion? What if I'm actually powerless to take that step on my own, thus proving to myself that conversion is impossible?
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Fortunately I have different buckets of conversion I can tap, the rotten sinner that I am. If I can't turn this person from athiest to deacon, maybe we can take the step together from athiest to 'maybe there is a God.' Then I'll throw my 5 loaves at the foot of the cross and beg God to take action because Jesus died on the cross.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				This argument is not circular but it's also not logically sound like a math proof. It's compelling enough to haunt you for the rest of your life, the kind of proof that when you ponder it a better proof will emerge unique to your relationship with God.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Argument number three</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Your priorities are an incoherent jumble. Do you want this person to convert? Why? What are your innermost objectives here? To win an argument? To score a goal for the team? To have a friend you can share your faith with? Because you don't like sin? Because you failed as a parent to pass on the faith? Is it because you're a judgemental pharisee?
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				If you're not clear on your motives and ultimate objective, you're not clear on the outcome either. You say, "I want you to convert", but what is it that you really want? In other words, what is it that is special and valuable about your personal relationship with Jesus unique to you and Jesus? How much are you asking the person to give up? How much are you willing to give up to get this pearl again?
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Picture yourself as the rich man who asks Jesus questions because he wants to be justified. Assuing you don't have a lot of money, what is it that Jesus would ask you to give up that would make you walk away sad because you wouldn't want to give it up?
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Next look through the gospels and find the person who was forgiven or healed that best matches your experience of Jesus in conversion. Is this what you want to give to this other person? That question was rhetorical. This is what you want to give to this other person because this is all you have.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Since you are human, despite your onetime event of conversion, you are still in the same state, still impacted by sin, still in need of this conversion in a deeper way. If you really want this, you're going through it again and will have the clarity to answer all of these questions as you invite someone else.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				In my case, I'm standing in the graveyard wailing day and night, breaking shackles and hitting myself with stones. You can throw in killing my neighbor to steal his garden, killing my top general because I committed adultry with his wife, persecuting Christians by breaking up families and putting them in prison. Then I go to confession and the chains are removed and I'm fixed. Going to confession is the ultimate act of conversion, and yes, I'm willing to share that with convincing arguments.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				This argument is a variant of the previous one, but at a deeper level. If you define your owner personal conversion objectives in a genuine and transparent, manner, the person you're trying to convert will follow you.  Thus you have to convert to make this happen.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Jesus said, "follow me". Follow me. Do what I am doing.
				</p>
				
			</div>	
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Argument number four</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are 3 ways to offend Jesus hanging on the cross. First, you can deny someone mercy who's asking for mercy. Second, you can tell them that God will not forgive them. Third you can tell someone that they don't need mercy when they really do, by telling them their sin is not a sin.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				In each case the mercy that Jesus won for us on the cross is denied to that person. But the third case is an especially subtle lie worthy of the father of lies himself. It's the easy way out of a conversation or difficult situation. Don't risk offending the person. Don't risk unpleasantness. Sacrifice mercy for the sake of congeniality.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Denying sin triples the problem. It's bad enough that one or more persons is opening living in contrary to the guidance of the bishops and the Holy Spirit, but if you tell them that they're just going to get angry, and now we've got people inside the church telling them that the bishops and the Holy Spirt are wrong and it's not a sin. Worst case scenario for offending the cross by removing it's power to forgive sin.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				This was the case in medevial Italy during the time of Francis. Francis was so converted that Francis would walk along doing his penance for his own sin, and as he silently passed the person, the person would run off to confession immediately. In one of my favorite stories recounted by Thomas of Celano, Francis walked through the town doing penance and the whole town went to confession.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Francis converted people by converting himself. This is the central tennant of Fransican spirituality; animals and Jedi robes are just flashy advertising techniques to draw one in. The question is this: did Francis convert people because he was converted or did he convert people because he was <i>converting</i>.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Converting or converted is irrelevant to my argument because none of us have converted to the point of receiving the stigmata. Conversion of self is the way to convert others.
				</p>
			</div>						
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Argument number five</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Do you want conversion, or do you want the satisfaction of seeing the person's conversion because of the time and effort you put into? Who is going to effect this conversion?
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Personally speaking, I want their conversion immediately. I even have a theological proof that I'm not being impatient and self-centered: Being far from God is bad. Sinning is bad. Dragging others into sin is bad. This is bad for 5 minutes, and is much worse for 5 years. The longer this goes on, the increased risk of sulfer fire fallng from the sky.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				But God sees things differently. He's got free will to deal with, not to mention wars and other problems. He is going to do the best he can and the best time for each person. His infinitely powerful mercy invalidates my proof.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				If I put 100% trust in God to hear my prayer for conversion, I'm closer to Jesus hanging silently on the cross putting his trust in God for the salvation of all despite the ultimate powerless and hopeless situation.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				There are only two important things in all of reality, space and time: my conversion and the conversion of the other person. I am compelled to put my trust in God for the conversion of another. What is left for me to worry about? My conversion.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				If it turns out that I don't care at all about conversion, the smoke of my prayer drifts sideways like Cain's. But as you can see, I'm concentrating on my conversion which is all I have left to do. Therefore I expect my prayer smoke to go straight up like Abel's.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Logically, this is an indirect proof: if I'm not converting myself, I don't care about conversion and I'm not really praying for the conversion of another. And this proves that the way to convert another is to convert yourself.
				</p>
			</div>				
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Argument number six</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Jesus died on the cross to take away our sin. He did what we wouldn't or couldn't do. All conversions, faith, and saving are effected solely by the power of the cross. 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				And yet as Catholics we hold this to be true and at the same time believe that we are perfectly capable of making up in our own sacrifices and penance what is lacking in the cross. What is lacking in the cross? Jesus is powerless if no one asks for or accepts mercy.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Therefore through our own penance and suffering we ask for and receive the conversion of others. Who wants to do penance and suffering?  No one does, not even stigmatists. If they wanted it, the act would have no merit and they'd have to be offered something else. But in an act of faith and conversion, I'm going to take that step on behalf of another and trust God to do the rest.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				It's this step of conversion that ultimately leads to another's conversion.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Does anything else besides your conversion have any merit in the eyes of God to bestow this mercy?
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Does prayer have any merit? No it doesn't unless it is part of an act of conversion. Look at the life of Saint Monica. She was a rotten person, evil person. She drove off her future daughter in law. Then she prayed and cried a lot and nothing happened. What is lost in the story is that she converted herself, as exemplified by the crazy selfless things she did later in the story, and as a result <i>of converting herself</i>, her son was finally converted.
