				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">The levels of the christian life</h1>
				<p class="lead">Feeling like ranking up?  Here is your cheat guide.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Why</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Debating whether defining the 100 levels of the Christian life is biblical or theological is as much fun as arguing about what the 100 levels are. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The last three generations of christians have not faired well in a well-off liberal western capitalistic society. On the order of 95%, a christian generation raised apostate children that is raising their children as pagans. A level 5 christian needs a wake up call, and this list is it. 
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The bible is full of levels as binaries. For example, one person builds their house on sand and another builds their house on a rock. Jesus promises his disciples houses, as does Paul, leaving those without the promise one step below. Part of the trick is to string all of these together. It's a giant exercise in salvation math.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Creating a unified ranking system is hard to do because of the different paths people take to holiness. Think Martha versus Mary. On a practical note, those who leave everything and join a religious order don't need my list. I'm narrowing this list to the situation of the average American.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The most difficult challenge I encountered is to define a level one Christian. What does it mean to be a level one Christian? Does it buy salvation? I'm inspired by Paul's letters to the early churches where he outlines the behavior of believers, including accepting every false teaching, anger, infighting, judging others, and having drunken orgies. Level one has to be a low bar or we wouldn't have a church at all. That's where I'm going to start.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
			<h2>Level's 0 to 9</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<i>Staring with the ministry of Jesus himself, observers have critisized christians as rotten, sinful people. These critics were correct then and they are correct now.</i>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				At <b>Level 1</b> a Christian gets out of bed, checks his phone, makes some coffee, and then decides that God will be his God instesd of all the alternative gods. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 2</b> At least once during the day, the person prays to God for help on some personal matter for himself or a family member, but mostly for himself.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 3</b> Mostly attends weekly services, and is not distracted during at least half of the service. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 4</b>
				Picks up a book written by the church fathers or a saint. Reads it.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 5</b> 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 6</b> 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 7</b> Gets a bible. Reads a page. Ponders it.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 8</b> Hears that fasting and prayer can convert a person. Skips a lunch on Tuesday for the conversion of a family member.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 9</b> Goes to confession. Confesses sins. Accepts forgiveness.
				</p>				
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">			
			<h2>Level's 10 to 19</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<i>.</i>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 10</b>Picks up a rosary and says five decades.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 1</b> Starts fasting on bread on Wednesdays and Fridays, at least breakfast and lunch
				</p>		
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 2</b> Here's about a church that is open in the evening on first friday of next month. Goes and sits. Listens to 5 old ladies saying the rosary and thinks <i>Maybe you'd have more people in your rosary group if you didn't pile on all the level 50 extra private revalation prayers and pick up the pace a bit.</i>
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 3</b> Starts reading the gospels, starting with each thing Jesus said. Is horrified to find out that Jesus prohibits being judgemental and rereads the gospels to see if there are any exemptions. Finds none.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 4</b>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 5</b>Begins prayer for people pulled over on the side of the road, aggressive drivers, homeless people, people in ambulances, and tow truck drivers. Because I would want someone to pray for me in that situation. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 6</b>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 7</b>Goes to mass each week.  Shows up early. Pauses after mass to admire the Eucharist. Starts going to mass during the week when possible.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 8</b> Starts buying cheaper non-branded food and delaying purchases. Because there are poor people.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 9</b>Starts going to confession monthly. Confesses same things each time. Looks enviously at other people in church who clearly aren't as bad as he is and begins to associate with the man in the tombs, the tax collector in the back of church, and the rich man and pharasee who waited for Jesus to die before they did anything worthwhile. Is horrified at the thought of sharing his faith with people because they'd find out he's a fraud.
				</p>	
			</div>	
			<div class="sj-prayer">			
			<h2>Level's 20 to 29</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<i>.</i>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 0</b>Rearranges his day so that he can say all the decades of the rosary each day.  
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 1</b> Creates a weekly budget of small denomination bills for the homeless based on the money he's saving.
				</p>		
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 2</b>Starts walking around the neighborhood because saying the rosary on your knees in front of the blessed sacrament is more of a level 60 thing. 
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 3</b>Hears in his heart, <i>I personally selected your bishop and annointed him with the spirit to guide you in matters of doctrine and worship. I deliver my teaching to you through him in the same way I gave my law to the Isrealites through Moses. If you rebel against him, you rebell against me.</i>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 4</b>Refrains from any gesture or outward appearance in mass that would distract any people behind him from focusing on the Eucharist or make them wonder if he distains the bishop.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 5</b>Creates own Psalter. Rewrites psalms so that any mention of enemies is reformulated either as my own sin or a request for mercy on the enemies.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 6</b>
				While listening to organ music in mass, decides that he must bring back protestants to the faith to get some decent praise music in mass. Starts pondering what it's going to take to get to level 50.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 7</b>
				Wakes up in the middle of the night and says the devine mercy chaplet. Sometimes for peace. Sometimes for the sould in purgatory.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 8</b> Goes to confession and confesses same things plus additional things. Wonders if he'll ever be good. Adds Monday to the fasting days for penance. Decides to fast for other people because it sure as heck isn't doing any good for me.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 9</b> Reads gospels again looking for alternate strategies to level up. Sees an emphasis on love so he decides to give that a try. Creates a working definition of love because no one else ever bothered to do it. I guess someone had to be the first to walk into the slums of Kolkata and to put poverty, chastity and obedience in the rule. 
				</p>	
			</div>		
			<div class="sj-prayer">			
			<h2>Level's 30 to 39</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<i>.</i>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 0</b> Love strategy is harder than you think for a hardened sinner, so he backtracks to silence to buy some time.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 1</b> On his daily rosary walks, sees signs in the windows and on lawns for people who need prayers. Devotes on the hail mary's and the divine mercy judgement day prayer for them. Wonders what level you need to be at to get a more immediate prayer.
				</p>		
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 2</b> Goes on a weekend pilgramage. Finds a monestary with an open church and sits there for the whole weekend, sleeping in the pews like a homeless person. Hears Jesus's voice in his heart and wonders what they are talking about.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 3</b>Begins saying the stations of the cross as mysteries instead of the regular 15 mysteries. Makes up an extra station to have 15.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 4</b>
				Wakes up in the middle of the night and sees a light on in either the laundry room or the bathroom. Knows that a soul in purgatory has come for help so he says the divine mercy chaplet. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 5</b> Decides to have a general confession and makes a list of root type generic sins. Notices that envy, anger, judgementalism, arguments, and malicious speech are not on the list. Looks in psalms to see if there is a thank you prayer for this type of thing. Does not find one. Cries instead.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 6</b> Goes to mass early to say a long list of hard core petitions for mercy and conversion. Adds prayers to a list of saints who's charism he admires.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Level 7</b> Reads Ezikiel. Notes that the repeated descriptions of wheels within wheels are exactly how mathematicians describe the projection of four dimensions onto three dimensions. Wonders what this means. Decides that God answers every prayer immediately, just not the place in time and space where I want this prayer to be answererd.

Finally, this person will pray with his disciples leading up to the birth of the church.
