				<h2>Definition</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Mary the mother of Jesus, aka mother of God, was not born with original sin like the rest of us.  At the end of the 11th century, an Englishman named Eadmer crafted a wonderful circular argument to prove this bit of theology: God could do it, it is proper for God to do, therefore he did it. Boom. QED.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				I prefer the proof that she was 'full of grace' implies that she had no sin whatsoever - not just born with out it but never having it ever.  Otherwise, 'full of grace' is not true; it would have to be 'almost full of grace' or 'full of grace with the exception of that one part from sin' or 'abounding in grace but not full'. (Minor note, in Acts 6, Stephen was 'filled with grace and power' instead, with the power portion making up for his deficiency of grace.)
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Much later the church clarified the theological finer points: All people were saved from sin by Jesus dying on the cross, including Mary. Nonetheless, whe wasn't born with it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>A brief history of sinless worlds</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Wouldn't it be great if God would have created a world with no sin, no suffering, and no death? He did, at least twice and possibly three times.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				God create angels, with him in heaven. That didn't go very well. A third of them rebelled.  Next God created man and woman in the garden; again, it was a fail, but learning from the first time, God put Adam and Eve in the space-time bubble, and by kicking them out of the garden, gave them a second chance.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The potential third time is the existence we are experiencing now, where we are invited by the new Adam to 'sin no more', to be 'perfect, like my heavenly father is perfect'.
				</p>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>God does nothing alone</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				When God created the world, he made if for Jesus and through Jesus. I'm not sure what making something 'through Jesus' means, but there were two involved in creation.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				After creation was complete, in the entirety of salvation history, God does nothing else alone. Every single thing he does, he does with a human partner. For example, when God parted the Red Sea, he did it only after Moses raised the staff. The role of Moses was pretty minor, but required. When God needed to warn or castigate an ancient king, he sent a prophet. When he wanted to announce salvation, he sent John the Baptist. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				When God wanted to come to earth and dwell among humans, he asked permssion from Mary. She is the partner he chose for the mind blowing act of becoming one of his creation. Did God need Mary to be a partner in this? Yes he needed her permission; if he didn't need it, he wouldn't have asked.
				</p>				
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Why type of a partner is she?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Comparing Moses putting a stick in the air to God moving millions of tons of water makes Moses act pretty trivial. What makes Moses heroic is the faith he showed when he was trapped between rough seas and the chariots of world's superpower bearing down in vengence. In the same way, Mary said yes and God did the miraculous.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Mary started the ministry of Jesus before it was time. Perhaps she knew it was time before he did. How would she know? She was chosen by the Father and the spouse of the Spirit; she was full grace.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">

			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>An intermediate pep talk</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				If you pray for a poor person and don't offer bread, Paul doesn't have kind words for you. Mother Teresa's plan of action is to pray a lot, then go deliver bread, then pray more. It's not just bread that the person needs - at a minimum they're going to need more bread and possibly clothes or a job. Moral problems are similar in the regard that the poor person might be tied up in a ball of knots. Kind words are not enough. We should untie at least one not.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				In preparation, let me point out a few things that are true for me, you and everybody. Picture a football coach in the locker room yelling at half time.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				God's mercy is infinite and invincible. We are fallible, sinful stubborn people heaping misery on ourselves, cutting a path of destruction in our lives and the lives of those we love. Thus, we and God make a perfect match. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Prayer is powerful, and hope cannot be dimmed in the light of such a merciful, powerful God who loves each of us 1,000,000 times more than we love ourselves. This is going to be a win-win-win outcome if God is involved.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				<i>If me dying on the cross didn't prove to you that I love you, what will? If you bring me a mountain of sin, I will bring you two mountains of mercy.</i>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				In 2023, Francis and other Bishops are currently working through their own intermediate approach that opens the door to mercy. It's different than Talkism but he is accused in the conservative Catholic media of calling "a bad" good. He's not doing this.  He is leaving the door open through listening, and thus denying a voice to Judgementalism. I'm interested to see where is path goes. Many fear that it will lead to a breakdown of doctrine and schism. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				I am now ready to address the two examples above by something more positive.
