				<p class="lead">Why it's a game changer</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Why you desperately need confession</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				I'm asked this question so much that I just assume I need to start by answering it: <i>Why wouldn't a loving merciful Jesus forgive me if I ask him to?</i>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Jesus would love to forgive you, but you hide from him wrapped in the chains of your sin clinging to your weaknesses and pride. Jesus doesn't need confession to forgive you, he gave us confession out of his goodness because <i>you need confession to accept his forgiveness.</i>. When you're asking Jesus to forgive you, you're really saying that it's not worth it to walk into a Catholic church, because this would require humility and obedience, and you don't want to present your sin to another person for fear of finding out that you're sitting on a mountain of sin. Which you are.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				But if you did go, he would not only forgive you, he would heal you and fix you and set you on the right path with his immense, loving power. His power is so great, that no one has ever come out of confession thinking it was a bad idea to go in the first place.  More commonly, people come out of confession shedding tears of relieve that they are free from a pile of chains.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>How confession works</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				As a courtesy to the priest, start confession by stating if you've ever gone, how long ago, do you go to mass, are you Catholic, are you living in violation of one of the many rules provided by our Bishops. The priest has heard it all before, but he needs to know where to start.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Then name your sins. If you are a man it's probably eating too much, drinking to much, additions, pornography, divorce, anger, cheating on taxes, ignoring God and replacing him with something else like sports or anixety. Whatever is your human weakness, name them and don't go into lots of detail. Do not state the reason for your sin. The priest will ask for detail on the topics where he needs it.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<i>Are these sins? Am I guilty? Do I have a good excuse? Is it my fault?</i> The priest may ask questions to discern these but you should go in assuming they are sins and name them. When the leper approached Jesus, he didn't worry about whether it was his fault for hanging out at the leper bar or experimenting with leper magazines or being abused as a child by a leper. He just wants the leprocy gone.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">					
				<h2>Wrapping up confession</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If you read the gospels, you'll notice that there were lots of miracles. Healings, conversions, prophecies, mighty deeds. Why do we not see these miracles all the time in the Christian life today? Part of the problem is that God in his mercy has given us health care and a fairly just set of laws, at least in the U.S. The other part of the problem is that Jesus gave us confession, and if you want to encounter him for a miricle, you have to go.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The confession room or booth is jammed with you, the priest, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. It's quite crowded in there. When you and the priest talk, Jesus and the Spirit are talking as well. Listen to the priest and you'll hear the voice of Jesus.  When the priest <i>absolves</i> you from your sin, he's using the power of the Holy Spirit which Jesus gave him, and you're going to walk out the door a free man.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				As a practical matter, before the priest absolves you for your sin, he'll ask you for an act of contrician. Look one up on your phone and read it. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The three things that happen next</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Read the story of the man in the tomb in Mark 5. He leaves the tomb free of a legion on demons. Jesus tells him to go home. He goes home to the same crappy surroundings that got him in the tomb in the first place, with beer in the fridge, the game on TV, and pornographic ads filling his youtube feed. He looks for a job. <i>What are your qualifications?</i> "I spent the last 20 years in the tombs cutting myself and breaking shackles." <i>Hmmm, I only see one job opening that matches your experience.</i> Read Matthew 12:43. The demon comes back to a clean house and finds it swept clean, so he brings back seven other demons.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				The first thing that happens next is that you're going to put some things in your house. For starters, you should put God first in your life, and by first, I mean praying when you wake up. Morning prayer of the hours was designed for this, but it was also designed for monks who have way more time than we do. This site began with the <a href="..\Prayer\DailyPrayer.html">Daily Prayer</a> page for exactly this reason. Prayer at meals and bed is a good start. Going to mass is a good start.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The next thing that will happen is that Satan, who is furious that you've broken your chains, will come back to attack you. <i>Was that a good confession? Am I really forgiven? Am I worthy of Jesus?</i> Doubts will set in. Temptation will increase.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The final thing that will happen is that you will go back to confession. Jesus doesn't expect you to win the battle alone. In fact, he may expect that you have no tools or skills or other virtues whatsoever to avoid sin. He expects in his infinite mercy and power that he will win the battle for you. But you have to stay close to him, and you have to go back to confession.
