				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">Beating Goliath</h1>
				<p class="lead">He found 5 smooth stones</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Prepare for battle</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Then, staff in hand, David selected five smooth stones from the wadi and put them in his shepherd's bag. With his sling in hand, he appoached Goliath.  Samuel 1 chapter 17.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The next time you sit in a church looking at Jesus in the tabernacle, say this prayer. <i>Jesus, I have nothing to offer but sin and misery. I have no skills, talents, or tools to do the work that you ask of me. Any graces you have given me I have wasted.</i>  Between 1933 and 1938, Jesus would appear frequently to a woman in Poland who is on her way to becoming the greatest saint of all time, with the possible exception of the guy crucified next to Jesus. She would say this to him. Jesus would answer her, <b>I know. I'm going to do all the work.</b>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Each of us is in between the woman in Poland and David on the battle field. Maybe we're both at the same time. What does an overmatched underdog do in the locker room before the game? They put their gear on and walk out to the field.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Three of the five stones</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The five stones include prayer, fasting, and giving to the poor. In a battle with the forces of evil, you can't survive 5 minutes as a Christian without these three. These are the starter stones.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are three root sins of pride, greed or gluttony, and vanity. Each of these has a technical definition that is not the same as modern usage. You are attacked all day long by temptations emerging from these pods of evil. There is a stone for each. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				One of these is your boss. The boss varies by person. You'll need all 5 stones to overcome the boss, but the three stones described here will get you past half of the levels in the battle over sin.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">					
				<h2>The three enemies</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The three root sins appear all over the bible from beginning to end. They are present in the garden of Eden, when Jesus is tempted, and it is these three that condemn him to death. They are called Vanity, Gluttony, Pride but they are also called the world, the flesh, and the devil.  Money is the root of all evil because money is the gasoline that makes each of these go from 0 to 60 in 4.8 seconds.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Pride puts you above God. If you have Pride, you are your own god and don't need the real God. As Pilot pointed out to Jesus, he decides is truth and who is guilty. The original sin was to eat of the "tree of knowledge of right and wrong", so you can be like gods. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Vanity puts the opinion of others above God. You worship what others think of you, inviting you to their parties, confiding in you, listening to what you say, and making you important. The Pharasees had no real authority or power other than the approval of others and their ability to make other people do things because of their fake authority.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Gluttony puts what you can get in first place. Eating too much is a subset of this. Perhaps greed is a better term for modern readers, but it would be greed for the good things, for your storehouse of extra things, your closet of clothes. If two beers are good, three beers must be even better.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The first stone</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The first stone is to pray more. It's usually abbreviated to <i>prayer</i>, but if you have a certain level of prayer in your life, and a certain level of Pride, you need to up your game to make progress. You may have noticed golf or baseball equipment tends to have numerous varieties of technology and design, sometimes for different conditions, and sometimes because it's better. You can safely assume that you would be better off with better prayers.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				The magic of prayer is that it requires faith in God. Prayer doesn't work without it. A prayer practice such as praying each day isn't going to last without hope. Prayer should draw you closer to God, who is love, and somewhere down the road you'll begin praying for others which is also love. When I mentioned <i>better prayer</i> above, I was thinking of prayers that more quickly and effectively open your heart to faith, hope and love. It is possible to say a prayer devoid of virtue, full of pride, such as the Pharasee who prayed "I'm glad I'm not like that sinner in the back," or Cane, who offered the inedible part of yesterday's game.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				As you practice prayer, you get better at hope, faith and love as a bonus. 
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The first video games, going all the way back to Zelda and Wolfenstein, included weapons upgrades. You defeat a minor enemy, find a more powerful weapon, upgrade a level, and battle a more challenging enemy. Prayer is not like that. More effective prayer has obedience and humility in it. Obedience and humility are the stumbling blocks of non-Catholics. It is impossible to be <i>obedient to God</i> unless you are obedient to another person, and it is impossible to be obedient if you agree with that person. It should hurt. If you look bad and feel stupid while doing it, you achieved humility. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				A <i>devotion</i> is a prayer or collection of prayers to repeat each day that focuses on one aspect of Jesus, his glory, suffering, or mission. Their are quite a few archaic Catholic devotions on youtube today promoted by Catholics who are in an open battle with the church Jesus founded; stay away from these. Practically speaking, obedience isn't there if you put yourself above the bishops and think you're better than the church. A complaint against the church is a complaint against Jesus.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If you want to get above level 12 in prayer, there is no avoiding the rosary. Level 13 humility requires you to acknowledge that Jesus is not going to ever visit you when you're riding your horse to Damascus. You can find him in the arms of his mother in a poor stable in Bethlehem. By level 42, Mary is the one in Revelation crushing the head of the serpant. Everyone in her infantry carries the rosary.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				To wrap things up, obedience and humility are required for the level of prayer you need to overcome the level of sin in your life, and that is why prayer is the counter measure to pride.
				</p>
			</div>	
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The second stone</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				To counteract gluttony or greed, you need to fast.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are a lot of great ways to fast, such as giving up X or Tiktok, turning your phone off each day after dinner, or avoiding other practices you should give up anyway. None of these are fasting once you get to level 2. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The only way to fast is to eat bread. If you skip meals or don't eat at all, you're demonstrating your heroic effort which is way more heroic than your weaker brothers, and humility goes out the window, undoing any benefits you hoped to gain by fasting. If you eat bread, there is no excuse not to fast. If you're hungry, eat more bread. It's not a diet, it's a fast.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				What is the benefit of fasting? You put yourself first your whole life. You are now acknowledging that you are second, and hopefully by denying yourself you are making room in your heart for Jesus, who should sit on a throne in first place, but is instead pushed out by all the things in your life that you value more. You are on your own incabable of filling the dumpster like the reality TV show Hoarders. But, but eating bread instead of what you normally eat, you take a step toward God in the hope that he carries you the rest of the way.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Where does <i>obedience</i> fit in to this? One act of true obedience is more pleasing to Jesus that all your fasting and sacrifices, according to what Jesus said to our top Polish saint. No one can make you fast or it's not a fast. You can't be obedient to yourself, your commitment, to Jesus, but only to someone who is annoying that you don't agree with and makes you do something good that you would otherwise not do.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>The third stone</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				Give alms. Give to the poor, ideally face-to-face.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Where as fasting is a private thing, giving is a public thing. One would think that giving would make you look good, thus not a good counter-measure to Vanity. If you get a thank you note, tax deduction or award for giving, if your giving involves a silent auction following cocktail hour, this doesn't count. The worst kind of giving ends with your name on a building.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Let's skip down to level 100 alms, the Dorothy Day level. The poor are smelly and rude. They are ungrateful. They steal anything that's left unattended, even if it has a chain on it. They don't deserve whatever you are giving them. They will misuse it or waste it. You give a ten dollar bill to a poor woman on your walk down the street, and on the way back you see her scratching off a lotto sheet.	When you give someone money, they don't say thanks, they ask for more. Give someone a pair of shoes and they ask for a bike. They have unlimited needs and your measily donations barely scratch the surface of their deficit.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are a lot of benefits to giving. The primary one is Jesus made it very clear that if you don't give to the poor you're not going to make it to heaven. He made it clear that when you give you are giving directly to him. You also help someone who needs it, aleviate suffering, make a better world.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In the context of a counter-measure to vanity, your donation is buying humility for a cheap price. Ponder the person who will probably buy drugs and alcohol with that $5, and who is ungrateful on top of that. How do you think God feels about what you do with what he gives you, and your own ungratefulness toward him? It's turning away from being appreciated by others to turning toward God. 
				</p>
			</div>				
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>A pile of stones</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				These three stones are a walk with Jesus. There's a life of experiences, of grace, of understanding that he himself will open up for you. People have written thousands of books on these topics. You don't need to read a book, with the possible exception of a good Dorothy Day biography. Instead, you need to meet Jesus in these three activities.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				The two remaining stones, the staff and the sling are found at the level when you cross the bridge from overcoming your own weakness to helping others. Don't be in a hurry. You overestimate yourself.
