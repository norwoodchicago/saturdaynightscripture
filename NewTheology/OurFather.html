				<h2>Ways to pray the Our Father</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are many ways to pray the Our Father, as their are many ways to read scripture.  The best way is to mean it.  But what does it mean?
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				When I pray the Our Father in a group with liberal Catholics who don't belive the teachings of the church, they frown at me and say, "OUR Father" a couple of extra times. I find this amusing. This is not a recommended way to say the Our Father. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>What does it mean</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The whole prayer is an orientation of priorities away from you and toward God. It is giving up your will and relying on him to get you through the day.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Some of the language is unique to this prayer, like the words <i>hallowed</i> and <i>trespasses</i>.  Sometimes the word <i>hallowed</i> refers to a field where people died in a battle.  When it's used in the Our Father, it means what it means when used in the Our Father.  Similiaryly the kingdom, God's will, and daily bread as used in the Our Father mean what they mean in the context of the Our Father. The concepts are illuminated by scripture, and they are illuminated by praying them and listening to the response. 
				</p>

				<h2>Some starter ideas</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Here are some things I pondered at different ages under different life situations.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Forgive us our trespasses</b> For a few years, I said, "Forgive us our sins and we forgive those who wronged us."  This works. I know people who say, "If your forgiveness is dependent on me forgiving others, then I forgive everyone everything ever."  Eventuallly I pondered the meaning of word <i>trespasses</i> for a few months and now I'm back to the original wording.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Hallowed be your name</b>  Try saying, "May your most sacred and Holy Name be hallowed in our hearts in first place to the excusionn of everything else."  The meaning of the word <i>hallowed</i> will begin to take shape in your heart, if not your mind. While this is a nice practice for a month or two, don't make it a permanent habit like you're Amish.  God needs you to move on; it's a long journey.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Your will be done</b>  Whose will is better, mine or God's? God's will. Whose will is easier to follow, less challenging, takes less patience and effor to figure out, and doesn't require humility and obedience? My will. The best you can love yourself is a poverty of love; the Father loves you 10,000,000 times more than you and has big plans for you. There are people who are far from God, and he has big plans for them too but needs help.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany"><b>Amusing sidenote</b> The Anabaptists, of which the Amish and the Menonites are two of many rebellious branches, decided that scripture needed to be rewritten into Venacular German against the wishes of the church. At this time, the church translated scripture into venacular languages all over the world; accusing the church of this particular negligence is the kind of lie only the father of lies can tell. What the church said was that you can't read scripture alone at home without the guidance of your leaders annointed with the Holy Spirit to guide you in doctrine, because if you do, bad things will happen. In this case, someone found a passage where a person was baptised as an adult, neglected to read the passages where people were baptised before adult, and decided they must break off from the Church that Jesus founded to form a church where only adults are baptised. 500 years later, the Anabaptist churches are stuck with scripture written in Olde German that no one understands let alone reads at home.  They will continue to suffer this from this self-imposed hell until they rejoin the church. Meanwhile, the Catholic church continues to update the vernacular text of scripture based on new technology and new archeaology.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Lately I've been pondering <b>Your kingdom come</b>.  Possibilities are a) it's the opposite of logic and common sense and b) it's not something I'll ever see or experience, but something others will see and experience because it will emminate from me.  In addition, I don't spend enough time taking <b>deliver us from evil</b> seriously enough.
				</p>

				<h2>Other ideas</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Spiritual Jedi Masters have other recommendations for the Our Father, like saying one phrase over and over again.  I'm sure you'll hear from these people and their ideas, some good, some unhelpful. One Jedi Master told me, "You are praying this prayer for people who are far from God." I found that to be a very profound insight.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				Regardless, my suggestions are like a new teacher trying to teach Algebra for the first time. When you pray this prayer, you are talking to the person who invented Algebra and has been teaching it for 6,000 years.
