				<h2>The argument</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				For the last few months, I've been arguing with my spiritual director that our professed theology is broken.    
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				It started at my very first spiritual direction session, when my Jedi Master told me, from a Fransican perspective, it all comes down to love.  "You need to have it", is how I summarixze this direction.  The last few sessions I've complained about this.  To make my point, I provided the following advice as a expert in finance to the suffering poor of the third world country where my director is from: "The problem with your countrypeople is that they lack money.  That's why they are poor.  The solution is to get money.  Problem solved."
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In my mind, there is no logical difference between my argument about money and his argument about love. This session didn't end well.
				</p>

				<h2>Spiritual reading on the way down</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Peace, joy, faith, hope and love are the signs of the Holy Spirit.  These are the fruits of a Christian life. These are the signs that we walk with Jesus and that he is present in our lives. It's in our bible, in my spiritual reading and if not obvious, it's certainly important.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Let's put love on hold for a minute.  Peace and joy are the two that I'm struggling with. 95% of our Catholic community has abandonded the faith in the 25 years I've been in this neighborhood.  I know these people. I've talked to them.  I saw them and their children walking to the Catholic school each day. It's not just that the children have left the faith, it's that the parents don't seem all that concerned as they walked away themselves. Isn't having peace and joy a bit offensive in the context that we're walzing blindly into the promised chastisement? We're raising a whole generation of pagans with pagan values pushing pagan causes. Is that a cause for pride?
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				This joy and peace that I feel like I lack, what do you think of that?  Are you considering baby joy that has been untested and I'm looking at the big boy joy that you get after you're executed on a cross?  Or is this joy the basic St. Terese joy that is in the little things, a joy you carry while you carry your share of the cross? Is this the joy you get watering your flowers as they come up on a sunny spring day, or the joy the mystics talk about when they see the face of God amidst the world's pain? If I don't have peace and joy, does this mean that I don't have the Holy Spirit; if I don't have the Holy Spirit, does this mean that bible, confession, fasting, penance and adoration are a waste of time?
				</p>

				<h2>Then the homilies began</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				For the last few months, I've been barraged by homilies joy, peace, and evangalization.  They all lack a single statement of practical advice. Last night a Franscian holy man I've never seen before gave a homily on the need for Evangalization.  This theme was "so go out and evangalize". I spent most of the homily thinking of how to fix such a broken homily. In fairness to the Friar, he may have provided some useful advice while I was busy in thought that I missed, but I doubt it.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Today's homily started with this advice about faith: go out and look for the presence of God. If you don't have faith, how do you do that?  Is why our diocesse has shrunk to a tenth of it's former size? If you don't show up with faith already, you're not going to get it here. Once the immigration faucet was turned off, most of us fell through the drain and now the tub is almost empty. Is the answer to go out and evangalize, and if so, is there someone in our Church who can tell me what that means?
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Before mass I sat there pondering how crabby and tired I was.  I was up late having an engaging, productive discussion with my high school aged son. The world may be coming down around us, and we're all blind to it, and I'm tired as coal, but at least I got this one thing right, so thanks to God for that because if he weren't around to help continuously, I would have been in bed getting a good night sleep instead of doing the one thing in the world I absolutely have to do. But I digress from my main complaint.

				<h2>Happiness hacks, Terese and Teresa</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Our Church is poorly run by uneducated fishermen whose only positive quality is that they were called by Jesus and annointed by the Holy Spirit to guide us. The rest of the world seems to appreciate that you need to provide some training and guidance before you pretend like your sermon has helped.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Look up "Happiness hacks" content or videos.  These are fantastic. You're looking for happiness in the wrong activities, wherein you can change your life by doing a litte act of kindness for someone each day.  We were genetically engineered for that. Talk to other humans - it works wonders.  If you want to start an exercize program, first start walking a litte each day, then a little more. Think of something small each day that you are thankful for.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				As Doctor of the Church Terese told us, do something little and let God do the rest.  
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Transitioning to Teresa of Kolcata, love is the one thing I've partially solved.  My overly qualified spiritual director told me that the secret of love is that you get it and then you share it. He talks in Spanish and Italian into Google Translate on his laptop while I follow along. It's possible that he is a dead saint and I just wander into the conference room of a rectory like Bruce Willis in the sixth sense and have a conversatino alone. My counter argument is that Teresa was a desert of pain on the inside and the only way she could experience the love of Jesus is to go out into the slum and share it with a poor person. Therefore, when I'm bereft of love, I walk down the street and have a conversation with a street person and give them some money. I have been hugged by street people. I am right. I am even right when the street person gives me a barrage of threats and explitives for 30 minutes.

				<h2>Turning to evangalization</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				While I sort out the secret to Joy and Peace, on my own, with no help from bad homilies, I'll mention a few hard won tips about evangalization.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				The first step toward evangalization is to make yourself accessible, and the way to do this is to introduce yourself. It's pretty simple: you see certain people repeatedly and you can just stop them on the street and say, "If seen you here for the last year (or I haven't) and I would like to know your name." Have a chat, admire their garden, just say hi. The army has boot camp where soldiers do stupid things like march with fake rifes and climb ropes - which they would never do in battle.  Evangalization boot camp is learning to remember peoples names, saying hi, and chatting about the weather.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				It's important to meet people in church, before or after the service, but don't ever try to evangalize someone who attends church.  It is very offensive, not only to that person, but to Jesus who has taken them in and guides their life.  In the context of Catholic teaching, I don't know of a single person who knows, agrees with, and follows our doctrine. Do not try to correct this.  Remind yoursef that you're still in boot camp and need a few years in the trenches before you are qualified to provide any pointers to a new recruit. Do not be helpful,
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Everybody is on a spectrum of faith, hope and love, all with different gifts and callings. A person who attends church is in the top 1% of 1%. You're target is the other 99% of humanity, and when you get down to the button 10%, your effort is Medal of Honor level heroics relevant. Mother Teresa didn't walk into the home of rich people to feed and clothe them.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are people who live their faith life by serving the poor. They preach by example. They live the teaching of Jesus and set the stage for the kingdom. They sure as hell don't evangalize because if they did millions of people would be in church. Instead, while said poor are being served by said poor serving saints, millions of people are leaving the church. I personally feel that whatever you're calling is, you are mandated to serve the poor at least as a side job, but don't pretend that it it evangalization. It is serving the poor. Don't misuse words like the pagans do and call red green and green red.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Once you are friendly and accessible, and your focus is those who need it and not those who don't need it, you're ready for step 2. Ask someone if they attend church. If you already know they don't, ask them why they don't. Listen to what they said, then spend the next few months thinking and praying about it. Back to my miliary analogy, at this point you're a skillless new soldier standing in a trench that someone else dug firing toward the horizon in the hopes that you'll hit someone. I don't ask this question unless I actually want to know what they are thinking. If you think this is an excuse to evangalize, then you should be silent. If a person has turned their back on the faith, their reasoning is standing in the way of their relationsihp with Jesus, so I would like to know what that reasonsing is. There's no way I'm going to solve this big issue with my response, again, that would be horribly offensive like telling a poor person they need money to be non-poor, but at least I can take a step forward by listening.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The most common resonses are #1 no one has ever asked and I haven't thought about it, and #2 an hour long discussion.  Beware of #3: this person might ask you why you have faith or go to church or believe in "it".  After a few dozen of these encounters you might have an answer that resonate in this specific context. It's disappointing when I don't have answer that fits a partical conversation or person.  Sometimes I say nothing or promise to answer after I've thought about it.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Step 1 is preparation, step 2 is the question, and step 3 is God.  Once you've mentioned the word "Catholic" in conversation with a nonCatholic, you've dropped the seed. God will send the rain, sun, nitrogen and whatever else that little seed needs and you're job is done. When I say "you're job is done" I mean your job is in no way even partially completed, but you can take additional direction from your king while you sit in adoration wondering what if anything to do next.

				<h2>Epilogue on peace and joy</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">			
				There are so many potential reasons why peach and joy ellude me. The one thing I know for certain is that the directive "have peace and joy because you are a Christian" is a fail in my case. Each day I wake up and think of something to be thankful for.  It's like looking through a dark hurricane for a mailbox that you presume is dry inside and declaring thanks that their is probably a dry spot until the wind gets it. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				There are so many potential reasons why faith and conversion ellude both former Catholics (largest denonmination in the United States) as well as non-Catholics.
