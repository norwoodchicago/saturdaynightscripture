				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">Talkism</h1>
				<p class="lead">The heresy of well meaning people, spreading their lack of faith</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Definition</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Talkism is a response to something painful, wrong, and tragic. To make the bad feelings go away, the responder, in the attempt to say something positive to make a troubled person feel better, states that it's not bad.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Back in the colonial fascist days, it was common to attribute poverty to the ordained order of things. The correct response to poverty is to allieviate it. If someone is hungry, give them some bread. Talkism solves poverty by denying it's cause and suffering. Talkism becomes heresy when poverty is attributed to God's will instead of the sinful condition of our world.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Modern examples</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				There are two examples I have personally heard each a dozen times over the last few decades. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In the first example, the parent is wounded that their child has abandonded the faith. The Talkism response denies problem: it is normal for a young person to quit the faith and they will come back. Problem solved.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				In the second example, a person disagrees with the moral doctrine of the Catholic bishops, usually on a matter that concerns them directly. The bishops have a list of do's and don'ts. A person who is living one of the don'ts or neglecting one of the do's is on the wrong side of the Church.  This is a problem of concern.  The Talkism response is to deny that the bishops are correct on this matter of doctrine everything is in fact OK. Problem solved.
				</p>				
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>A cause for Judgementalism</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				The most common antidote to Talkism is Judgementalism. If something is wrong, there is probably moral failure behind it, maybe a mountain of sin. Judgementalism will point that out instead of making the "Not OK" into OK.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Judgementalism is a fasttrack to hell.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Judgementalism is also hypocritical and innefective. The end result is perhaps worse than Talkism. At least with Talkism the person with the problem feels the glimmer of false hope. With judgementalism, hope is crushed. In either case, the person is no better than before. A wise person once told me, "Don't tell someone they are wrong, because they won't listen."
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>An intermediate pep talk</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				If you pray for a poor person and don't offer bread, Paul doesn't have kind words for you. Mother Teresa's plan of action is to pray a lot, then go deliver bread, then pray more. It's not just bread that the person needs - at a minimum they're going to need more bread and possibly clothes or a job. Moral problems are similar in the regard that the poor person might be tied up in a ball of knots. Kind words are not enough. We should untie at least one not.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				In preparation, let me point out a few things that are true for me, you and everybody. Picture a football coach in the locker room yelling at half time.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				God's mercy is infinite and invincible. We are fallible, sinful stubborn people heaping misery on ourselves, cutting a path of destruction in our lives and the lives of those we love. Thus, we and God make a perfect match. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Prayer is powerful, and hope cannot be dimmed in the light of such a merciful, powerful God who loves each of us 1,000,000 times more than we love ourselves. This is going to be a win-win-win outcome if God is involved.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				<i>If me dying on the cross didn't prove to you that I love you, what will? If you bring me a mountain of sin, I will bring you two mountains of mercy.</i>
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				In 2023, Francis and other Bishops are currently working through their own intermediate approach that opens the door to mercy. It's different than Talkism but he is accused in the conservative Catholic media of calling "a bad" good. He's not doing this.  He is leaving the door open through listening, and thus denying a voice to Judgementalism. I'm interested to see where is path goes. Many fear that it will lead to a breakdown of doctrine and schism. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				I am now ready to address the two examples above by something more positive.
