				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">The Definition of Wisdom</h1>
				<p class="lead">It's the oppositie of what you think it is</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>The two definitions</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The pagan definition for wisdom is the collective guidance learned over the centuries by various cultures that can be used to culturely steer a person in their decision making on topics that require hundreds of years of experience to determine which option has the best outcome.  
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The catholic definition of wisdom is this: God is giving you one day to live and will help and support you this day if you make him your God and stay focused on what is right according to his Church. Tomorrow, you will get a different day. Repeat until you die.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Catholic wisdom is hard. The biggest problem is anxiously waiting all day for God to fix your problems. For problems that take more than a day to fix, it gets worse each day. "If only I could win the lotto", you think, "I could fix my problems with money and wouldn't need God". Later you learn that you're encouraged to give all that you have to the poor and true joy is in suffering. 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				The quest for a replacement god is a constant in all of human history. Replacement gods cause mass suffering, famine and death, but only if they can prevent the real God from helping. Thus the battle between the Catholic church and human wisdom.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>How to know the difference</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				While you should strive to regurgitate whatever your teacher wants to hear on graded class assignments, it's useful to know the difference between God's wisdom and the world's wisdom because you can then crush the arguments of your opponents.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				If a person makes a statement that needs a thorough logical proof or scientific research to determine it's veracity, but everyone jumps on it waving flags like a parade float, then it's the world's wisdom and is wrong. Other ways to identify worldly wisdom: it lumps people into groups, it contradicts anything the Catholic church teaches, it makes groups or organizations into enemies, it espouses or supports violence.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Once you have identified a worldly wisdom candidate, it is much harder to call out lies. When the mob is holding a witch underwater to see if she is a witch or not, it's a little late to point out that witches don't exist.
				</p>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Religion is the opiate of the people</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The church has always held that money is bad. Any money you have after paying your bills is owed to the poor. No one who is rich will get into heaven. You can't get into heaven without serving the poor. The most powerful people in history in terms of moving the ball forward on human rights and justice were penniless. The most evil people in history were the richest.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The Jews put this philosophy into practice in counter-intuitive ways: When the Jews left Egypt, the collected all of their jewelry and fabrics to build an extravagent tent for the arch of the covenant, and repeated this when they built the temple, twice. Each year, they take the first of their harvest and give it away, despite being hungry. Christians are encouraged to give away 10% of their income each year, which if you do the math is twice the amount you could hope to save if you weren't giving it away.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The family is the model of the church, a reflection of the Trinity, and the centerpiece of God's plan of salvation. God is a creation entity, and having a family is joining him in what he does best - creating. The only meaningful thing people can do is to have children. Widespread education began by the Jews in a first century because how else could all children learn about God if they couldn't read scriptures? The Christian family values children, their education and their welfare. The causes of poverty are the breakdown in the family. Icronically, the end result of Christianity is wealth on an individual and societal scale. You can't do much for an uneducated skillless factory worker, but the same poor factory worker can produce a million dollar lawyer. In other words, wealth creation is 99% a generational thing. Mother Teresa picked Dalit orphans out of the garbage dump and two generations later their grandchildren are sending her organization over $800 million dollars a year in donations.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				Christianity is a walth producer.  Christianity officially holds that wealth is bad unless given away to help others. Christianity holds the most meaningful thing you can do as a human is have children, followed by helping others, followed by giving away your money.
				</p>				
				</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Enter Marx</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				"Religion is the opiate of the people".  Marx doesn't offer any scientific or logical proof of this. He just imputes injustice and everyone jumps on the band wagon. Why was this such a successful slogan? Was it because it was the message his audience wanted to hear? Was it because there was already an  us-versus-them rivalry against the church? Or is it simply because people suck at context? It was because people found were looking for a new fake God.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Nonetheless, for Jewish and Christian families, raising children in a stable environment of love, hard work, education, and forgoing pleasure today for success tomorrow is the only recipe for success. There is a Korean version of this formula that shortcuts the family element (0.8% birth rate) and will eliminate their culture. The correct formula is not success now. Fransicans, Don Bosco, and Mother Teresa were examples of people who extended this formula for success by picking Dalit orphans out of garbage dumps and putting them in school.  
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Marx said a) wealth is important, b) religion is holding you back from that, and c) wealth is more important than religion so dump religion, and d) you should do violence to rich people.  Religion says a) wealth is not important, b) wealth naturally eminates over time from religion, and c) rich people are evil but so is violence. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Ponder this assertion: If there is something that I should have that someone else has, me doing violence to them is justifiable. This justifies all violence.
				</p>

			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>It's tied to the cross</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Humans have this prideful skill of remaking reality in their best interest. For example, my habit of exploiting the poor for my own gain is a good thing because I deserve to be rich and they deserve to be poor in my selfish twisted reasoning. In numerous situations every day, it is easy to call a bad thing a good thing and much harder to admit my failure.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				The ultimate fatal lie that we tell ourselves is that God is not offering us mercy, free of charge, undeserved, out of sheer love of us, that we can just accept. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				To overcome this barrier, Jesus came down to earth, taught God's truth long enough to be condemned to death for it. There he is, hanging on the cross to demonstrate how deep his love is, from which the offer of mercy springs.  It's really hard to hold on to one's lies when standing in front of the cross witnessing the agony of the God of truth.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Jesus came her to be poorer than you. He suffered more than you. He endured public humiliation, was deserted by his group, and was tortured to death, all to make the point that you can be forgiven for your sins. And when I say you, I mean me.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				None of this could have happened without Jesus becoming human.
