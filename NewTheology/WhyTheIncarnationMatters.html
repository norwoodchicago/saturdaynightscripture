				<h2>It seems relatively trivial</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				My spiritual director noted the event wherein God became a human is the most important event. A sense of underwhelmingness came over me. Followed by me staring blankly, then admitting in my heart that I had chosen the world's worst spiritual director.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Jesus died on the cross for us. That is everything. He rose from the dead. That is something. If I rank order all of the earth shattering events in the life of Jesus, standing at the well with the Sarmaritan women is in the top 10. Multiplying the loaves, healing the blind.  Telling the thief and rebel he will be with me today in paradise, top 5. Being born is last on my list. It's more of an necessary first step than something to celebrate.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				On a recent podcast, my favorite popular bishop shared the theory that Jesus would have become human whether or not whether or not humans needed it. At the risk that I didn't understand what was said, the basis of this argument is that human activity is not a sufficient basis for God's wilful decision. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In this article, I'm going to share the reasons I came up with why the incarnation is important and possibly refute the argument that God preordained it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Your pride, for starters</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				God created humans as powerful beings, gods with a little g, predestined to join him his perfect unity place where there is no disention or division. The only catch is that you have to freely choose it, and powerful + free will is a dangerous combination that will inevitably result in you turning against God. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				When Jesus came to show us how to approach the father, he came as a little helpless baby who had nothing to say because he wasn't old enough yet to speak. He was born to a young woman who has no known useful skills or admirable qualities other than God chose her and she said yes. Therefore know that there is someone in this universe that God will always consider orders of magnitude better than you. Also know that she was one of the few people who God trusted enough to tell you he was coming and for 91% of Jesus's mission on earth, if you wanted to find him, he would be with her. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				This was enough to make Lucifer rebel and choose hell over having to swallow his pride. It is enough that people who turn against the church that Jesus founded must also turn against Mary.  
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				My first argument for the importance of the incarnation is that it demonstrates to us that God's ways are the opposite as our ways. Crawling on your knees to God is not enough to convey how desparate you need mercy. You are so far away from God's plan that you must first crawl to a skilless young woman of no notable quality, possibly illerterate, very poor, and ask her to point which direction you should be crawling in order to make it to Jesus.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				What is that voice inside you that is insensed that I would place such a high importance on this little woman and seemingly put her in the place of Jesus? What is the outrage? That is your pride. Q.E.D.
				</p>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>We're a team</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				In the first half of salvation history, there was definately a huge gap between humans and God. God helps humans, then they turn away from him and live their godless ways, then he lets them experience the fruit of their efforts, in the form of famine, smiting and exile.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The prophets had the clearest view of this situation asked God if they could just quit or die. In their prophet language, the complaint is that they wanted to see the face of God; in the current time there is just suffering and desolation, but God who lives outside of space-time is smiling on the positive outcome of all of this which he sees is many times greater than the cost. If we could see the face of God, we'd see that it is all worth it.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				The incarnation closes the gap. Jesus being born puts God directly on our team as part of humanity. There is no us versus him anymore. Even better, we can see the face of God from now on. Unfortunately, he's mostly suffering for us and being on his team means carrying a cross.  But still, it's his face and it's the face of mercy. This is a pretty good reason to be excited about the incarnation.
				</p>				
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>But did he have to do it?</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				According to my possibly erroneous interpretation of the theology of the incarnation, God's will was to do it and what we as humans do or don't do is not enouch to impact his will. I find this ridiculous and it undermines the beauty of incarnation.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				There are numerous instances in the bible where God does something because of what humanity does or because we asked. God doesn't have to do anything accept be who he is. Nonetheless, he hears the cry and acts.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Jesus, who is God, started his ministry because Mary asked him to. He fed the 5,000 because they were hungry. He healed the paralytic because of the four friends who damaged the roof. He gave the theif a get out of jail free card because the thief asked. Much of what God does in salvation history is according to his plan to help us. He helps us because we need help.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Could Jesus have saved us if instead of being born in Nazaereth and being crucified, he instead magically appeard on the Pharoh's throne in Egypt as a powerful king who didn't suffer at all, did his thing, and then floated away on a chariot? Could God have created a math system where 2 + 2 = 3?
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Jesus came into the world to save us. It may not be possible to know what God would have done if we didn't need saving. Who would ask such a question? A person who needs to spend more time on their knees comtemplating mercy. 
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>It's tied to the cross</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Humans have this prideful skill of remaking reality in their best interest. For example, my habit of exploiting the poor for my own gain is a good thing because I deserve to be rich and they deserve to be poor in my selfish twisted reasoning. In numerous situations every day, it is easy to call a bad thing a good thing and much harder to admit my failure.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				The ultimate fatal lie that we tell ourselves is that God is not offering us mercy, free of charge, undeserved, out of sheer love of us, that we can just accept. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				To overcome this barrier, Jesus came down to earth, taught God's truth long enough to be condemned to death for it. There he is, hanging on the cross to demonstrate how deep his love is, from which the offer of mercy springs.  It's really hard to hold on to one's lies when standing in front of the cross witnessing the agony of the God of truth.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				Jesus came her to be poorer than you. He suffered more than you. He endured public humiliation, was deserted by his group, and was tortured to death, all to make the point that you can be forgiven for your sins. And when I say you, I mean me.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
				None of this could have happened without Jesus becoming human.
