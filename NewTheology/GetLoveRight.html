				<h1 class="sns-topic-number">A definition of love</h1>
				<p class="lead">I'm surprised to find that the most important concept of our faith is so poorly defined.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>The #1 thing</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Love is the central concept in Christianity.  If you get that right, you will convert many people. If you get it wrong, they will be confused by your preaching.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Traiditional Christian theology splits love into 4 classifications - Eros, Filia, Agape and Storge.  These are different types of relationships that help steer the converstation toward the point that Christian love is something selfless and different.  But these are not definitions of love.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Paul puts some contraints on love, e.g. patient, kind and gentle. 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Bishop Robert Barron defines love "to will the good of the other."  This foundation points in the right direction.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
			<h2>Where this must lead</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Many mathematicians have tried to prove the prime number theorem and none of them have succeeded.  A really good attempt, at best, will produce a new mathematics.  In addition to arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and calculus, there are 92 other types of mathematics to date. 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				In the same way, the attempt to thoroughly articulate a technical definition of love might just end up exploring a facit of Jesus, who is love, or the Trinity, which is the source of all love.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				The gospels are somewhat helpful. Mostly Jesus walks around saying what to do and what not to do and healing people. The story of the Good Samaritan is a complete definition but it is a parable and not .
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>Type 1 Love</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Type 1 love is a silent love of appreciation where you value the other person. This is the type of love God conveys to you even though you're a rotten, useless sinner and a disgrace to Christianity. This love emminates from the heart of God; he loves you because he's God and not because of who you are. Jesus showed this type of love to Levi, to the man in the tombs, to the woman at the well and the prostitute. It draws people to Jesus.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Type 1 love is so quiet that a person may go years without noticing it. Type 1 love is conveyed by attention, by a happy or sympathetic glance on your face toward the other person, by you listening to what they say with interest and understanding.  As soon as you say anything past a greeting, you've moved past Type 1 love onto Type 2 love.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The 4 greek classifications I mentioned above are 4 relationships where the different types of love play a different role. Type 1 love comes naturally in the context of two young lovers meeting for the first time (Eros) or a parent sitting next to the bed of an infant while the infant sleeps (Storge). A brother accepts brother even though brother has a long list of glaring flaws and an annoying personality (Philia). 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The agape context is with a stranger or aquaintance. Showing Type 1 love to a stranger is to trust someone who doesn't deserve to be trusted, to apologize to someone who has wronged you, to give where nothing is expected. Again, it all has to be done silently and may go unnoticed; you do all this in your heart and convey it with a glance.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Trust is the key. Through Type 1 love, you earn the trust of a person by giving them your trust. The reason that you freely give trust, apologies, high regard (all silently) is because of God. God is active in this persons life and when he pulls the trigger, this person is going to look for a friend. You just have to wait, and while you're waiting, you can silently appreciate a homeless drunk because he is a child of God and a brother in a fallen world.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Because of type 1 love, Mother Teresa walked into the slums of Kolkata.
				</p>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Type 1 love many not always be the first thing a person sees in you, but it should be. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">  
				<h2>Type 2 Love</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Type 2 love starts when you resond to a person's needs. In Type 2 Love, you given them what they think they need at the moment, ignoring yourself, ignoring your needs, thoughts, and feelings.
				</p>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				What does this person need? If they're homeless, a few bucks and a person to stand in their inner space (which may be smelly) and ask them how they are doing or what they'er thinking, in other words to acknowledge them as a person of value.  For all the other relataionships in our lives, Type 2 love manifests itself as sympathy, happy words, an offer of help, but in most cases a lot of listening with the occassional follow up question.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				What you can't do in Type 2 love is correct, suggest, advise or frown; some may explicitly ask for this but almost no one does. They just want to be right for a moment. Type 2 love cements trust, and by 'trust' I mean that the person expects you to not dissapprove of their life experience.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Type 2 love sets the stage for selflessness. It is consistent with patient, kind and gentle. It puts the othe person first.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				They key to Type 2 love is that the person in front of you has needs as they define them, and for that momement that person, their opinions, their needs is the most important person in the world to God and thus to you.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Type 3 Love</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Once you've mastered Type 1 and Type 2 love, you can sit on the hill of your estate waiting for the Prodigal son to return. When this person meets Jesus or is blinded by a loving act of grace directly from Jesus himself, this person will want more than a pleasant glance or a kind word. This person will have questions and need guidance.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The shift from Type 2 Love to Type 3 Love is the shift from what the person wants to what the person needs. For a jobless person with hungry kids, want and need are identical. For your pagan neighbor fighting a war against the church, want and need are opposed to eachother.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Most people make the wrong decision most of the time. This is a fact of humans, and there is much scientific research on this topic. Most of our economy depends on people making the wrong choice, and marketers know how to influence decision making to take your money. The decision making part of the brain finishes development by age 25; during the teen years, in the absense of the cerebral cortex, the brain uses the lobe in charge of emotions to make decisions. My point is that when you excercise Type 3 love properly, you're most likely going to get a negative response and possibly stoned or imprisoned.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>The definition of love</h2>				
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Love may or may not be motivated by feelings or emotions, but it has to be a concrete action backed by a concrete decision. Sometimes these actions flow naturally from an positive disposition toward others, and sometimes despite negative feelings. The role that emotions play in love is that over time, as you empty the person and replace with Jesus in the measuring cup of the human soul, there is a consistency between the inner self of emotions and the actions. Until then, you just jump in and do it whether you feel it or not.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Requirement 1: Love is a sacrifice</b> of some kind. An act of love must result in you having something before the act and not having it after the act. For example, you want to share something joyful with a friend, but they just lost their job, so you silently listen instead. Every time you do an act of love, you're going to lose a little bit of time, money, having your opinion heard and acknowledged, or winning an argument.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				<b>Requirement 2: You want good for the other person.</b> This is where Type 3 Love diverges from Type 2 Love. In Type 2 Love, an addicted person expresses the need for a bottle of whisky and a cigarette, and you acknowledge that a bottle of wiskey and cigarette would indeed be nice under the circumstance; the good you wish for them is an acknowledgement that they are heard and this is in fact what they think. But when you transition to Type 3 Love, the good you want for them is an addiction cessation program and for them to get their life together. Stepping from what they think is good and what is really good is not going to be well received.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The definition of love implies that you are going to pay a price and not only not be thanked, but possibly yelled at with explitives for your trouble.  Saint Paul lists attributes of love like patience, gentle, kind, and these are vital to your success with Type 3 Love. Saint Paul was also stoned, whipped and beaten countless times for his trouble. This either means he is warning us to be gentle so we don't get beaten or warning us we'll get beaten anyway.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				While Type 2 love is agreeable and supportive, sometimes under challenging circumstances, it doesn't not allow one to apostate from the faith just because a friend or relative has turned against the teachings of the bishops and the Holy Spirit.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>Type 3a Love verses Type 3b Love</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				When you encounter a person who needs to change and grow, you can excersize Type 3b Love.  A parent makes their child clean the dishes and go to school; Type 3b Love plays an important role in <i>early</i> parenting (Storge).  For a husband, Type 3b Love is usually off the table in a marriage (Eros).  
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Type 3b has an opposite face, like a coin, and this is Big Mercy. In short, little mercy is feeding the hungry and clothing the naked. Big Mercy is forgiving the people who cause hunger and nakedness or any other bad situation. You can see the Mercy sandwich fully described in the Magnificat in Luke, made up of 2 mercy buns, 3 patties of Big Mercy meat, and various condiments of small mercy.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				With Agape, the type of love which covers all of your relationships besides family, Type 3b Love waits for an opportunity of mercy, and then it strikes.  The entire Christian life is practicing Type 1, 2 and 3a Love in preparation for Type 3b Love.  Forgiving is excersizing Type 3b Love of varying degrees. But the real power of Type 3b love is evangalization.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Picture a person living in their little castle fighting their quiet war against the Church that Jesus founded to guide us in matters of morals, doctrine and worship. At some point in their life, due to their indifference or someone else's sin, they turned their back on the church and walked away from the Eucharist. Their personal political choices line up nicely with the platforms published on the websites of the American Atheist and Satanist organizations and are directly opposed to the Holy Spirit and the Catholic Bishops.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				One day this person thinks to themselves <i>I remember going to church when I was in grade school. Who can I seek out to discuss this?</i>  Who they seek out is a knowledgeable person who they trust who shows them Type 1 & 2 love. As you walk by their castle one day, they stick their head out the window and state , "You go to church don't you? I need to talk.  Also, get a goose." 
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				The door was just opened for big mercy. How will you respond?
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				A cautionary note on Type 3b Love: Jesus accepted each person, but discarded and/or changed everything about them.  <i>Does Jesus accept me as I am?</i>, a person asks. The response is "No. Jesus accepts you, but the <i>as I am</i> part goes in the dumpster." However, since I am not Jesus, I am not capable of changing everything at once. Type 3b Love may take baby steps.
				</p>
			</div>			
			<div class="sj-prayer">
				<h2>From Type 3b Love to Type 4 Love</h2>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
				 Suppose you walk by another person in a castle who's heart is stubborn and stoney. You call out, "Why did you turn your back on the Eucharist and the chuch Jesus founded to bring us close to him?" This person gets angry and throws some garbage out the window. They are chained to their sin.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				What is the resolution to this story?  Someone is going to suffer, and Jesus already did his part so it's either you or them. One possibility is that this person is going to experience calamaties and they'll end up in the gutter like a drug addict who needed to lose his job and family and hit rock bottom before seeking help. I did a statistical sample in my neighborhood and there is a zero percent chance this is going to happen. That leaves you.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				How much are you willing to suffer to free a neighbor, aquaintance, or stranger from their chains?  A parent who loves their child begins suffering the moment the child leaves, and in the example of Monica, continues suffering as they leave themselves in search of their child (Storge). A spouse suffers by proximity (Eros). A brother suffers by annoyance (Philia). Agape covers all other cases, including suffering for a stranger or enemy.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Type 4 Love is suffering.  All Christians are called to Type 4 love.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sj-prayer">				
				<h2>How to love</h2>					
				<p class="sj-litany">
				All four types of love (or five types if type 3 is counted twice) require continual preparation and practice.  If you think you're good at Type 2 Love (e.g., listening), what about Type 2 Love the day your cat dies when you have the flu and you got a parking ticket? All types of love require God as the source to deposit the love in your heart for sharing with others. All types of love are contrary to our culture, society, and our internal sinful self.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				To be perfect at Love is to be empty of self and full of Jesus. In other words, impossible. I know some people who are good at each type; it seems like it comes naturally to them but once I got to know them I found out it was a lot of work. For me, love is like having 5,000 people unexpectly over for dinner on the same night. You start with a small step. You give Jesus your 2 fish and 5 loaves. You expect a miricle. Then when you see that they're all eating something, you notice there is no wine and all you have is 4 big empty jars.
