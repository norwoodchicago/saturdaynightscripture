					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 6</h2>
				<p>				
Do not reprove me in your anger, LORD, nor punish me in your wrath. Have pity on me, LORD, for I am weak. Heal me, LORD, for my bones are shuddering. 
				</p><p>	
My soul too is shuddering greatly. And you, LORD, how long? 
</p><p>	
Turn back, LORD, rescue my soul. Save me because of your mercy. For in death there is no remembrance of you. Who praises you in Sheol? 
</p><p>	
I am wearied with sighing. All night long I drench my bed with tears. I soak my couch with weeping. My eyes are dimmed with sorrow, worn out because of all my foes. 
</p><p>	
Away from me, all who do evil! The LORD has heard the sound of my weeping. The LORD has heard my plea. The LORD will receive my prayer.My foes will all be disgraced and will shudder greatly. They will turn back in sudden disgrace.

				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p>	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Mark 3:7</h2>A large crowd came to him after hearing what great things he did.</div>			
				<p>	
Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great crowd followed him from Galilee, from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. He spoke to his disciples that a boat should be ready because of the crushing crowd, so that they wouldn't press on him. For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried, 'You are the Son of God!' He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.
