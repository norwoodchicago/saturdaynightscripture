				<h2>Psalm 34</h2>
				<p>
I will bless Yahweh at all times.
His praise will always be in my mouth.
My soul shall boast in Yahweh.
The humble shall hear of it and be glad.
Oh magnify Yahweh with me.
Let's exalt his name together.
I sought Yahweh, and he answered me,
and delivered me from all my fears.
				</p>
				<p>
They looked to him, and were radiant.
Their faces shall never be covered with shame.
This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard him,
and saved him out of all his troubles.
Yahweh's angel encamps around those who fear him,
and delivers them.
Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good.
Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
				</p>
				<p>
Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints,
for there is no lack with those who fear him.
Keep your tongue from evil,
and your lips from speaking lies.
Depart from evil, and do good.
Seek peace, and pursue it.
Yahweh's eyes are toward the righteous.
His ears listen to their cry.
				</p>
				<p>
Yahweh's face is against those who do evil,
to cut off their memory from the earth.
The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears,
and delivers them out of all their troubles.
Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart,
and saves those who have a crushed spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
but Yahweh delivers him out of them all.
				</p>
				<p>
Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants.
None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.

				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p>
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I look to you to help me, to show me the way, to solve my problems. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.
				</p>

			<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Acts 9:11</h2>"A man from Tarsus named Saul is staying at the house of Judas. He is there praying."</div>			
				<p>
But Ananias replied, "Lord, I have heard from many sources about this man, what evil things he has done to your holy ones in Jerusalem. And here he has authority from the chief priests to imprison all who call upon your name."
</p><p>
But the Lord said to him, "Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before Gentiles, kings, and Israelites, and I will show him what he will have to suffer for my name."
</p><p>
So Ananias went and entered the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, "Saul, my brother, the Lord has sent me, Jesus who appeared to you on the way by which you came, that you may regain your sight and be filled with the holy Spirit."
</p><p>
Immediately things like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. He got up and was baptized, and when he had eaten, he recovered his strength.
</p><p>
Paul stayed some days with the disciples in Damascus, and he began at once to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.

				<h2>Hear our prayers</h2>
				<p>
					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do.  I put my trust in you.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Father, next time I want to win an argument, remind me how much you've given me.  Help me to let the argument go.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, thanks for dying on the cross for me.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, I trust in you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.

				<p class="sns-of">Father, give me a new, clean heart to love you better.
