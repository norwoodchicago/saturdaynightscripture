<h2>Psalm 145</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
I will exalt you, my God, the King.
I will praise your name forever and ever.
Every day I will praise you.
I will extol your name forever and ever.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised!
His greatness is unsearchable.
One generation will commend your works to another, and will declare your mighty acts.
I will meditate on the glorious majesty of your honor, on your wondrous works.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
Men will speak of the might of your awesome acts.
I will declare your greatness.
They will utter the memory of your great goodness, and will sing of your righteousness.
Yahweh is gracious, merciful, slow to anger, and of great loving kindness.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
Yahweh is good to all.
His tender mercies are over all his works.
All your works will give thanks to you, Yahweh.
Your saints will extol you.
They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, and talk about your power, to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.
Your dominion endures throughout all generations.
Yahweh is faithful in all his words, and loving in all his deeds.
Yahweh upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who are bowed down.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
The eyes of all wait for you. You give them their food in due season.
You open your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
Yahweh is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works.
Yahweh is near to all those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him.
He also will hear their cry, and will save them.
Yahweh preserves all those who love him,
but he will destroy all the wicked.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh.
Let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.
</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I look to you to help me, to show me the way, to solve my problems. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Matthew 17:7</h2>"Get up, and don't be afraid."</div>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. He was changed before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
</p>
<p class="sj-litany">
Peter spoke out and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let's make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them. A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him." When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up, and don't be afraid." 
</p>
<p class="sj-litany">
Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
				</p>

			<div class="sns-prayer">
				<h2>Hear our prayers</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do.  I put my trust in you.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
					Father, I don't praise you enough for your immense love that you have for us.  Praise you for your immense love.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Jesus, help me to keep my eyes on you alone.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Jesus, I trust in you.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.
				</p>
				<p class="sns-of">Father, may there be nothing in my heart that is not pleasing to you.</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">Amen.</p>
