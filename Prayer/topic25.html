					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 75</h2>
				<p>
We give thanks to you, God.
We give thanks, for your Name is near.
Men tell about your wondrous works.
When I choose the appointed time,
I will judge blamelessly.
The earth and all its inhabitants quake.
I firmly hold its pillars.
				</p>
				<p>
I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!"
I said to the wicked, "Don't lift up the horn.
Don't lift up your horn on high.
Don't speak with a stiff neck."
For neither from the east, nor from the west,
nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.
But God is the judge.
He puts down one, and lifts up another.
For in Yahweh's hand there is a cup,
full of foaming wine mixed with spices.
He pours it out.
Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
				</p>
				<p>
But I will declare this forever,
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,
but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Mark 15:17</h2>The soldiers placed a crown on his head.</div>			
				<p>	
The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort. They clothed him with purple.  They weaved a crown of thorns and put it on him. They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" They struck his head with a reed and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. When they had finished mocking him, they took the purple cloak off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.

					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do. I place all my challenges and problems in your hands. I put my trust in you. Lord, hear my prayer.

				<p>	
					Father in heaven, please help men everywhere with their problems today, especially those facing the worst situations and hardest challenges.  Be with them.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, help me to love my enemies.  Lord, hear my prayer.

				<p>
					Jesus, when there is nothing to say, help me to be silent. Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, I trust in you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.
