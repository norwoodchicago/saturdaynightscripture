					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 75</h2>
				<p>
We give thanks to you, God.
We give thanks, for your Name is near.
Men tell about your wondrous works.
When I choose the appointed time,
I will judge blamelessly.
The earth and all its inhabitants quake.
I firmly hold its pillars.
				</p>
				<p>
I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!"
I said to the wicked, "Don't lift up the horn.
Don't lift up your horn on high.
Don't speak with a stiff neck."
For neither from the east, nor from the west,
nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.
But God is the judge.
He puts down one, and lifts up another.
For in Yahweh's hand there is a cup,
full of foaming wine mixed with spices.
He pours it out.
Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
				</p>
				<p>
But I will declare this forever,
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,
but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.				
				</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p>	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Solve my problems.  Amen.

				<p>	
Jesus answered, "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. 
</p><p>
"A certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion. The Samaritan poured on oil and wine on his wonnds and put bandages on them. He set him on his horse, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.' Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to the victim of the robbers?"
</p><p>
He said, "The one who showed mercy."
</p><p>
Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."
