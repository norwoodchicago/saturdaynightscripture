					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 47</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
Clap your hands, all you nations.
Shout to God with the voice of triumph!
For Yahweh Most High is awesome.
He is a great King over all the earth.
He subdues nations under us,
and peoples under our feet.
He chooses our inheritance for us,
the glory of Jacob whom he loved.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
God has gone up with a shout,
Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
Sing praises to God! Sing praises!
Sing praises to our King! Sing praises!
For God is the King of all the earth.
Sing praises with understanding.
God reigns over the nations.
God sits on his holy throne.
The princes of the peoples are gathered together,
the people of the God of Abraham.
For the shields of the earth belong to God.
He is greatly exalted!

				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength, my defender.  Amen.

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Matthew 5:44</h2>"But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."</div>			
				<p class="sj-litany">	
"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same? If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?  Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect."
