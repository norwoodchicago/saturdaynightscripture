			<h2>Psalm 38</h2>
			<p>
Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your wrath,
nor punish me in your exasperation.
For your arrows have shot me,
your hand presses hard on me.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,
neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
For my iniquities have buried me.
As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
My wounds are loathsome and corrupt
I have groaned in anguish from my heart.
Lord, all my pleas are before you.
				</p>
			<p> 
My groaning is not hidden from you.
My heart throbs.
My strength fails me.
The light of my eyes is gone.
My friends and my acquaintances stand aloof from my plague.
My relatives stay far away.
Those who seek after my life also lay traps.
Those who want to hurt me speak mischievous things,
and meditate deceits all day long.
 				</p>
			<p>
But I, as a deaf man, don't hear.
I am as a mute man who doesn't open his mouth.
Yes, I am as a man who doesn't hear,
who doesn't rebuke them.
For I hope in you, Yahweh.
You will answer, Lord my God.
For I said, "Don't let them gloat over me,
or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."
For I am ready to fall.
				</p>
			<p>
My pain is continually before me.
For I will declare my iniquity.
I will be sorry for my sin.
But my enemies are vigorous and many.
Those who hate me without reason are numerous.
They who render evil for good are also adversaries to me,
because I follow what is good.
				</p>
			<p>				
				Don't forsake me, Yahweh.
My God, don't be far from me.
Hurry to help me,
Lord, my savior.
</p>
			<h2>Let us pray</h2>
			<p>	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.

				<h2>Luke 15:12</h2>The younger son said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of your property.'</div>
			<p>	
He entered servitude to one of the inhabitants of that country, and was sent into his fields to feed pigs. He wanted to fill his belly with the pods that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.  When he came to his senses, he thought, 'How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to spare, and I'm dying with hunger!  I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.' 
</p>
			<p>
He travelled to his father. While he was still far off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and ran, fell on his neck, and kissed him. The son said to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son."
</p>
			<p>
But the father said to his servants, "Bring out the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let's eat and celebrate. For  my son was dead and is alive again. He was lost and has been found."

					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do. I place all my challenges and problems in your hands. I put my trust in you. Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
			<p>	
					Lord, give me the courage to change, and the help to do it.  Lord, hear my prayer.

			<p>
					Jesus, help me to forgive all those who wrong me.  Lord, hear my prayer.

			<p>
					Jesus, let this be a day of mercy. Lord, hear my prayer.

			<p>
					Jesus, I trust in you.

			<p>
					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.
