				<h2>Psalm 121</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
I will lift up my eyes to the hills.
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from Yahweh,
who made heaven and earth.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">  
He will not allow your foot to be moved.
He who keeps you will not slumber.
He who keeps Israel
will neither slumber nor sleep.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany"> 
Yahweh is your keeper.
Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.
The sun will not harm you by day,
nor the moon by night.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany"> 
Yahweh will keep you from all evil.
He will keep your soul.
Yahweh will watch your coming and going,
from this time forward, and forever.
				</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>

					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Solve my problems.  Amen.

The angel answered the women, "Don't be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and now he goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Behold what I have told you."
</p>
<p class="sj-litany">
They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. 
</p>
<p class="sj-litany">
As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"
