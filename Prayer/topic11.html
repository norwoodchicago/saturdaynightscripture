				<h2>Psalm 40</h2>
				<p>
I waited patiently for Yahweh.
He turned to me, and heard my cry.
He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,
out of the miry clay.
He set my feet on a rock,
and gave me a firm place to stand.
He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.
Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.
</p><p>
Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust,
and doesn't respect the proud, nor such as turn away to lies.
Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,
and your thoughts which are toward us.
They can't be declared back to you.
If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted.
Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire.
You have opened my ears.
You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.
</p><p>
Then I said, "Behold, I have come.
It is written about me in the book in the scroll.
I delight to do your will, my God.
Yes, your law is within my heart."
I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.
Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you know.
I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.
I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.
I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.
Don't withhold your mercy from me, Yahweh.
Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.
</p><p>
For innumerable evils have surrounded me.
My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.
They are more than the hairs of my head.
My heart has failed me.
Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me.
Hurry to help me, Yahweh.
</p><p>
Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
Let such as love your salvation say continually, "Let Yahweh be exalted!"
But I am poor and needy.
May the Lord think about me.
You are my help and my deliverer.
Don't delay, my God.

					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Solve my problems.  Amen.

			<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Matthew 18:22</h2>"I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times."</div>			
				<p>	
"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'  But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. 
</p>
<p>	
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same? If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?

					Father in heaven, please help men everywhere with their problems today, especially those facing the worst situations and hardest challenges.  Be with them.  Lord, hear my prayer.
