				<h2>Psalm 47</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
Clap your hands, all you nations.
Shout to God with the voice of triumph!
For Yahweh Most High is awesome.
He is a great King over all the earth.
He subdues nations under us,
and peoples under our feet.
He chooses our inheritance for us,
the glory of Jacob whom he loved.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
God has gone up with a shout,
Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
Sing praises to God! Sing praises!
Sing praises to our King! Sing praises!
For God is the King of all the earth.
Sing praises with understanding.
God reigns over the nations.
God sits on his holy throne.
The princes of the peoples are gathered together,
the people of the God of Abraham.
For the shields of the earth belong to God.
He is greatly exalted!

					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength, my defender.  Amen.

"Don't judge, so that you won't be judged. For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.

Why do you see the splinter that is in your brother's eye, but don't consider the two-by-four that is in your own eye? Or how will you tell your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye,' and behold, the plank is in your own eye? You hypocrite! 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye."
