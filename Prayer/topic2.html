					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 38</h2>
				<p>
Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your wrath,
nor punish me in your exasperation.
For your arrows have shot me,
your hand presses hard on me.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,
neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
For my iniquities have buried me.
As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
My wounds are loathsome and corrupt
I have groaned in anguish from my heart.
Lord, all my pleas are before you.
				</p>
				<p> 
My groaning is not hidden from you.
My heart throbs.
My strength fails me.
The light of my eyes is gone.
My friends and my acquaintances stand aloof from my plague.
My relatives stay far away.
Those who seek after my life also lay traps.
Those who want to hurt me speak mischievous things,
and meditate deceits all day long.
 				</p>
				<p>
But I, as a deaf man, don't hear.
I am as a mute man who doesn't open his mouth.
Yes, I am as a man who doesn't hear,
who doesn't rebuke them.
For I hope in you, Yahweh.
You will answer, Lord my God.
For I said, "Don't let them gloat over me,
or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."
For I am ready to fall.
				</p>
				<p>
My pain is continually before me.
For I will declare my iniquity.
I will be sorry for my sin.
But my enemies are vigorous and many.
Those who hate me without reason are numerous.
They who render evil for good are also adversaries to me,
because I follow what is good.
				</p>
				<p>				
				Don't forsake me, Yahweh.
My God, don't be far from me.
Hurry to help me,
Lord, my savior.
</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p>	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength, my defender.  Amen.

				<p>	
"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not murder;' and 'Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.' But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of the judgment. Whoever says to his brother, 'Raca!' will be in danger of the council. Whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna."
</p><p>
"If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Agree with your adversary quickly while you are with him on the way; lest the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison. Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there until you have paid the last penny."
