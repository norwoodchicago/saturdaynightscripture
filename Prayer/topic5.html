				<h2>Psalm 51</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				Have mercy on me, God, according to your unfailing love.
				From your stockpile of mercy, blot out my transgressions. 
				Wash me thoroughly from my guilt.  
				Cleanse me from my sin.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				For I know my failure.
				My sin is constantly before me.
				Against you, and you only, I have sinned,
				and done that which is evil in your sight,
				so you may be proved right when you speak,
				and justified when you judge.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Behold, I was born in iniquity.
				My mother conceived me in sin.
				Behold, you desire truth in the my heart.
				You teach me wisdom in the deepest part of my mind.
				Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.
				Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
				Let me hear joy and gladness,
				that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Hide your face from my sins,
				and blot out all of my iniquities.
				Create in me a clean heart, O God.
				Renew a right spirit within me. Don't throw me from your presence,
				and don't take your Holy Spirit from me.
				Restore to me the joy of your salvation.
				Uphold me with a willing spirit.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Then I will teach transgressors your ways.
				Sinners will be converted to you.
				Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation.
				My tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.
				Lord, open my lips.
				My mouth will declare your praise.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				For you don't delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.
				You have no pleasure in burnt offering.
				The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.
				O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.
				Build the walls of Jerusalem.
				Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
				in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings.
				Then they will offer bulls on your altar.
				</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p class="sns-lup">Father in Heaven, if you forgive me according to how I forgive others, then I forgive everyone.  Amen.

They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs. He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains, because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him. Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him, and crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don't torment me." For he said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"

 As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed pleaded to remain with him. He didn't allow him, but said to him, "Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you."

				<p class="sj-litany">
					Jesus, Give me the strength to forgive everyone everything ever. Lead me on the steps to forgiveness, and teach me the way. Lord, hear my prayer.

				<p class="sns-of">Father, give me the strength to withstand temptation.</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">Amen.</p>
