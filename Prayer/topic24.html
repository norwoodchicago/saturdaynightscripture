					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 31</h2>
				<p>
In you, Yahweh, I take refuge.
Let me never be disappointed.
Deliver me in your righteousness.
Bow down your ear to me.
Deliver me quickly.
Be to me a strong rock,
a house of defense to save me.
				</p>
				<p>
For you are my rock and my fortress,
therefore for your name's sake lead me and guide me.
Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,
for you are my stronghold.
Into your hand I commend my spirit.
				</p>
				<p>
You redeem me, Yahweh, God of truth.
I hate those who regard lying vanities,
but I trust in Yahweh.
I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness,
for you have seen my affliction.
You have known my soul in adversities.
You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.
You have set my feet in a large place.
				</p>
				<p>
Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in distress.				
				</p>

				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p>	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Solve my problems.  Amen.

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Luke 24:5</h2>"Why do you seek the living among the dead?"</div>			
				<p>	
On the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb.  They brought the spices which they had prepared.   They found the stone rolled away from the tomb. They entered and didn't find the Lord Jesus' body. 
</p><p>	
While they were greatly confused by this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing. Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the ground.
</p><p>	
The men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead? He isn't here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee, saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again?"
</p><p>	
They remembered his words.

					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do. I place all my challenges and problems in your hands. I put my trust in you. Lord, hear my prayer.

					Father in heaven, please help men everywhere with their problems today, especially those facing the worst situations and hardest challenges.  Be with them.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, show me my faults and help me fix them.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, someone out there has it worse.  Help that person.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, I trust in you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.
