					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 34</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
I will bless Yahweh at all times.
His praise will always be in my mouth.
My soul shall boast in Yahweh.
The humble shall hear of it and be glad.
Oh magnify Yahweh with me.
Let's exalt his name together.
I sought Yahweh, and he answered me,
and delivered me from all my fears.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
They looked to him, and were radiant.
Their faces shall never be covered with shame.
This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard him,
and saved him out of all his troubles.
Yahweh's angel encamps around those who fear him,
and delivers them.
Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good.
Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints,
for there is no lack with those who fear him.
Keep your tongue from evil,
and your lips from speaking lies.
Depart from evil, and do good.
Seek peace, and pursue it.
Yahweh's eyes are toward the righteous.
His ears listen to their cry.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
Yahweh's face is against those who do evil,
to cut off their memory from the earth.
The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears,
and delivers them out of all their troubles.
Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart,
and saves those who have a crushed spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
but Yahweh delivers him out of them all.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants.
None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.				
				</p>

				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I look to you to help me, to show me the way, to solve my problems. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Acts 9:5</h2>Who are you, sir?</div>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
On his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, a light from the sky suddenly flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"
</p><p class="sj-litany">
He said, "Who are you, sir?" The reply came, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting."
</p><p class="sj-litany">
"Now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do." The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, for they heard the voice but could see no one. Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing, so they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus. For three days he was unable to see, and he neither ate nor drank.

				<h2>Hear our prayers</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do.  I put my trust in you.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
					Father, thanks for all the things you've given me, especially those things I've never thought about or bothered to thank you before.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Jesus, thanks for dying on the cross for me.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Jesus, I trust in you.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.
