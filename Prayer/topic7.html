					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 95</h2>
				<p>
				Sing to Yahweh a new song!
				Sing to Yahweh, all the earth.
				Sing to Yahweh!
				Bless his name!
				</p>
				<p> 
				Proclaim his salvation from day to day!
				Declare his glory among the nations,
				his marvelous works among all the peoples.
				For Yahweh is great, and greatly to be praised!
 				</p>
				<p>
He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
but Yahweh made the heavens.
Honor and majesty are before him.
				</p>
				<p>
Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
Give credit to Yahweh, you families of nations,
Give credit to Yahweh for his glory and strength.
Give credit to Yahweh the glory due to his name.
				</p>
				<p>
Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
Worship Yahweh in holy array.
Tremble before him, all the earth.
Say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns."
				</p>
				<p>
The world is also established.
It can't be moved.
He will judge the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice.
				</p>
				<p>
Let the sea roar, and its fullness!
Let the field and all that is in it exult!
Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy.
They will sing before the LORD, for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his truth.
				</p>				
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p>
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I look to you to help me, to show me the way, to solve my problems. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.
				</p>

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Acts 8:1</h2>On that day, there broke out a severe persecution of the church in Jerusalem, and all were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria.</div>			
				<p>
Now those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.  Thus Philip went down to Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah to them. With one accord, the crowds paid attention to what was said by Philip when they heard it and saw the signs he was doing. For unclean spirits, crying out in a loud voice, came out of many possessed people, and many paralyzed and crippled people were cured. There was great joy in that city.

				<h2>Hear our prayers</h2>
				<p>
					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do.  I put my trust in you.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Father, thanks for all the things you've given me, especially those things I've never thought about or bothered to thank you before.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, thanks for dying on the cross for me.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, I trust in you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.
				</p>
				<p class="sns-of">Father, fill my heart with things that you want there.</p>
				<p>Amen.</p>
