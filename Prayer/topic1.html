					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 5</h2>
				<p>
Give ear to my words, O LORD. Understand my sighing. Attend to the sound of my cry, my king and my God!
</p><p>
For to you I will pray, LORD. In the morning you will hear my voice. In the morning I will plead before you and wait. You are not a god who delights in evil. No wicked person finds refuge with you. The arrogant cannot stand before your eyes. You hate all who do evil. You destroy those who speak falsely. A bloody and fraudulent man, the LORD abhors.
</p><p>
But I, through the abundance of your mercy, will enter into your house. I will bow down toward your holy sanctuary out of fear of you. LORD, guide me in your justice because of my foes. Make straight your way before me. For there is no sincerity in their mouth. Their heart is corrupt. Their throat is an open grave. On their tongue are subtle lies.
</p><p>
Declare them guilty, God. Make them fall by their own devices. Drive them out for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.
</p><p>
Then all who trust in you will be glad and forever shout for joy. You will protect them and those will rejoice in you who love your name.
</p><p>
For you, LORD, bless the just one. You surround him with favor like a shield.
				</p>
			<h2>Let us pray</h2>
			<p>
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I look to you to help me, to show me the way, to solve my problems. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.

			<p>
On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let's go over to the other side." Leaving the crowd, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him. A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled. He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and asked him, "Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?"
He awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" The wind ceased and there was a great calm. He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?"

					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.
