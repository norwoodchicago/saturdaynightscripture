				<h2>Psalm 32</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
Blessed is he whose fault is removed,
whose sin is forgiven.
Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn't impute iniquity,
in whose spirit there is no deceit.
When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
For day and night your hand was heavy on me.
My strength was sapped in the heat of summer.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
I acknowledged my sin to you.
I didn't hide my iniquity.
I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,
and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found.
Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.
You are my hiding place.
You will preserve me from trouble.
You will surround me with songs of deliverance.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.
I will counsel you with my eye on you.
Don't be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding,
who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you.
Many sorrows come to the wicked,
but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh.
Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous!
Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!
				</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Luke 15:7</h2>There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents.</div>			
				<p class="sj-litany">	
He told them this parable.  "Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep and lost one of them, wouldn't leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?  When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing. When he returns home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!' I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.
