					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 51</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				Have mercy on me, God, according to your unfailing love.
				From your stockpile of mercy, blot out my transgressions. 
				Wash me thoroughly from my guilt.  
				Cleanse me from my sin.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				For I know my failure.
				My sin is constantly before me.
				Against you, and you only, I have sinned,
				and done that which is evil in your sight,
				so you may be proved right when you speak,
				and justified when you judge.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Behold, I was born in iniquity.
				My mother conceived me in sin.
				Behold, you desire truth in the my heart.
				You teach me wisdom in the deepest part of my mind.
				Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.
				Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
				Let me hear joy and gladness,
				that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Hide your face from my sins,
				and blot out all of my iniquities.
				Create in me a clean heart, O God.
				Renew a right spirit within me. Don't throw me from your presence,
				and don't take your Holy Spirit from me.
				Restore to me the joy of your salvation.
				Uphold me with a willing spirit.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Then I will teach transgressors your ways.
				Sinners will be converted to you.
				Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation.
				My tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.
				Lord, open my lips.
				My mouth will declare your praise.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				For you don't delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.
				You have no pleasure in burnt offering.
				The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.
				O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.
				Build the walls of Jerusalem.
				Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
				in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings.
				Then they will offer bulls on your altar.
				</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p class="sns-lup">Father in Heaven, if you forgive me according to how I forgive others, then I forgive everyone.  Amen.

 He came out and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him. When he was at the place, he said to them, "Pray that you don't enter into temptation."
 </p><p class="sj-litany">
He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and he knelt down and prayed, "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."
An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. In agony, he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. When he rose up from his prayer, he found  the disciples sleeping because of grief. He said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not undergo the test."

				<h2>Hear our prayers</h2>

					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do. I place all my challenges and problems in your hands. I put my trust in you. Lord, hear my prayer.

				<p class="sj-litany">	
					Father in heaven, take away my chains, unbind me, and forgive me.  Lord, hear my prayer.

				<p class="sj-litany">
					Jesus, Give me the strength to forgive everyone everything ever. Lead me on the steps to forgiveness, and teach me the way. Lord, hear my prayer.

					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.

				<p class="sns-of">Father, give me the strength to overcome temptation.</p>
