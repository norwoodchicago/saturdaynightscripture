				<h2>Psalm 47</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
Clap your hands, all you nations.
Shout to God with the voice of triumph!
For Yahweh Most High is awesome.
He is a great King over all the earth.
He subdues nations under us,
and peoples under our feet.
He chooses our inheritance for us,
the glory of Jacob whom he loved.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
God has gone up with a shout,
Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
Sing praises to God! Sing praises!
Sing praises to our King! Sing praises!
For God is the King of all the earth.
Sing praises with understanding.
God reigns over the nations.
God sits on his holy throne.
The princes of the peoples are gathered together,
the people of the God of Abraham.
For the shields of the earth belong to God.
He is greatly exalted!

"Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine and does them, I consider him a wise man who built his house on a rock.  The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it didn't fall, for it was founded on the rock. Everyone who hears these words of mine and doesn't do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house. The house fell and its fall was great."
