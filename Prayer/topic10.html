				<h2>Psalm 60</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
God, you have rejected us.
You have broken us down.
You have been angry.
Restore us, again.
You have made the land tremble.
You have torn it.
Mend its fractures,
for it quakes.
You have shown your people hard things.
You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.
You have given a banner to those who fear you,
that it may be displayed because of the truth.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany"> 
So that your beloved may be delivered,
save with your right hand, and answer us.
God has spoken from his sanctuary:
"I will triumph.
I will divide Shechem,
and measure out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine.
Ephraim also is the defense of my head.
Judah is my scepter.
Moab is my wash basin.
I will throw my sandal on Edom.
I shout in triumph over Philistia."
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
Who will bring me into the strong city?
Who has led me to Edom?
Haven't you, God, rejected us?
You don't go out with our armies, God.
Give us help against the adversary,
for the help of man is vain.
Through God we will do valiantly,
for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.				
				</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Solve my problems.  Amen.

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Mark 16:14</h2>He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart.</div>			
				<p class="sj-litany">	
When he had risen, early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons. She went and told his companions who were mourning and weeping. When they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
After this he appeared in another form to two of them walking along on their way to the country.  They returned and told the others; but they did not believe them either.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table. He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn't believe those who had seen him after he had risen.

					<h2>Hear our prayers</h2>
					<p class="sj-litany">
					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do. I place all my challenges and problems in your hands. I put my trust in you. Lord, hear my prayer.

					<p class="sj-litany">	
					Father in heaven, please help men everywhere with their problems today, especially those facing the worst situations and hardest challenges.  Be with them.  Lord, hear my prayer.
					</p>
					<p class="sj-litany">
					Jesus, show me my faults and help me fix them.  Lord, hear my prayer.
					</p>
					<p class="sj-litany">
					Jesus, someone out there has it worse.  Help that person.  Lord, hear my prayer.
					</p>
					<p class="sj-litany">
					Jesus, I trust in you.
					</p>
					<p class="sj-litany">
					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.
					</p>
					<p class="sns-of">Jesus, have mercy on me for every time I hurt someone.</p>
