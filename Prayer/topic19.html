				<h2>Psalm 51</h2>
				<p>				
				Have mercy on me, God, according to your unfailing love.
				From your stockpile of mercy, blot out my transgressions. 
				Wash me thoroughly from my guilt.  
				Cleanse me from my sin.
				</p><p>
				For I know my failure.
				My sin is constantly before me.
				Against you, and you only, I have sinned,
				and done that which is evil in your sight,
				so you may be proved right when you speak,
				and justified when you judge.
				</p><p>
				Behold, I was born in iniquity.
				My mother conceived me in sin.
				Behold, you desire truth in the my heart.
				You teach me wisdom in the deepest part of my mind.
				Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.
				Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
				Let me hear joy and gladness,
				that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.
				</p><p>
				Hide your face from my sins,
				and blot out all of my iniquities.
				Create in me a clean heart, O God.
				Renew a right spirit within me. Don't throw me from your presence,
				and don't take your Holy Spirit from me.
				Restore to me the joy of your salvation.
				Uphold me with a willing spirit.
				</p><p>
				Then I will teach transgressors your ways.
				Sinners will be converted to you.
				Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation.
				My tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.
				Lord, open my lips.
				My mouth will declare your praise.
				</p><p>
				For you don't delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.
				You have no pleasure in burnt offering.
				The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.
				O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart.
				</p><p>
				Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.
				Build the walls of Jerusalem.
				Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
				in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings.
				Then they will offer bulls on your altar.

				<p>	
There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. When they came to the place that is called "The Skull", they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
</p>
<p>	
One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!"
But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Don't you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? And we are condemned justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong." He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom."
</p>
<p>	
Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise."

					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do. I place all my challenges and problems in your hands. I put my trust in you. Lord, hear my prayer.

				<p>	
					Father in heaven, take away my chains, unbind me, and forgive me.  Lord, hear my prayer.

				<p>
					Jesus, Give me the strength to forgive everyone everything ever. Lead me on the steps to forgiveness, and teach me the way. Lord, hear my prayer.

					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
