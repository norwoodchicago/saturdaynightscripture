					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 31</h2>
				<p>
In you, Yahweh, I take refuge.
Let me never be disappointed.
Deliver me in your righteousness.
Bow down your ear to me.
Deliver me quickly.
Be to me a strong rock,
a house of defense to save me.
				</p><p>
For you are my rock and my fortress,
therefore for your name's sake lead me and guide me.
Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,
for you are my stronghold.
Into your hand I commend my spirit.
								</p><p>
You redeem me, Yahweh, God of truth.
I hate those who regard lying vanities,
but I trust in Yahweh.
I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness,
for you have seen my affliction.
You have known my soul in adversities.
You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.
You have set my feet in a large place.
				</p>
				<p>Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in distress.				
				</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p>	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Solve my problems.  Amen.

				</div>			
				<p>	
When they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
</p><p>
He said to them, "It isn't for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to all parts of the earth."
</p><p>
When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing, who also said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky?"

			<h2>Hear our prayers</h2>
				<p>
					Father in heaven, please help me today in all things that I do. I place all my challenges and problems in your hands. I put my trust in you. Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Father in heaven, please help men everywhere with their problems today, especially those facing the worst situations and hardest challenges.  Be with them.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, show me my faults and help me fix them.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, someone out there has it worse.  Help that person.  Lord, hear my prayer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jesus, I trust in you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.
