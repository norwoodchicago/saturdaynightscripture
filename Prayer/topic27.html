					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 102</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
LORD, hear my prayer. Let my cry come to you. Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress. Turn your ear to me when I call, answer me quickly. 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
For my days vanish like smoke. My bones burn away as in a furnace. My heart is withered, dried up like grass, too wasted to eat my food. From my loud groaning I become just skin and bones. I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins. I lie awake and moan, like a lone sparrow on the roof. All day long my enemies taunt me.  In their rage, they make my name a curse. I eat ashes like bread, mingle my drink with tears, because of your furious wrath. You lifted me up just to cast me down.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
My days are like a lengthening shadow. I wither like the grass. But you, LORD, are enthroned forever. Your renown is for all generations. You will again show mercy to Zion. Now is the time for pity. The appointed time has come. Its stones are dear to your servants. Its dust moves them to pity. The nations shall fear your name, LORD, all the kings of the earth, your glory/
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Once the LORD has rebuilt Zion and appeared in glory. Heeding the plea of the lowly, not scorning their prayer.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Let this be written for the next generation, for a people not yet born, that they may praise the LORD. “The LORD looked down from the holy heights, viewed the earth from heaven, to attend to the groaning of the prisoners, to release those doomed to die.”
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Then the LORD’s name will be declared on Zion, his praise in Jerusalem, when peoples and kingdoms gather to serve the LORD.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
He has shattered my strength in mid-course. Has cut short my days. I plead, O my God, do not take me in the midst of my days. Your years last through all generations. Of old you laid the earth’s foundations. The heavens are the work of your hands. They perish, but you remain. They all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you change them and they are changed. But you are the same, your years have no end.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
May the children of your servants live on. May their descendants live in your presence.
</p>
				</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.
				</p>

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Luke 18:13</h2>God, be merciful to me, a sinner.</div>			
				<p class="sj-litany">	
Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. The Pharisee stood and prayed by himself like this: "God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men: extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get." But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn't even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner!" I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.

			<h2>Hear our prayers</h2>

					Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name.  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
					Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.  Protect us from temptation and deliver us from evil.
