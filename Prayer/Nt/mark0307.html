Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great crowd followed him from Galilee, from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. 
 </p><p class="sj-litany">
A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. He spoke to his disciples that a boat should be ready because of the crushing crowd, so that they wouldn't press on him. 
 </p><p class="sj-litany">
For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried, 'You are the Son of God!' He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.
