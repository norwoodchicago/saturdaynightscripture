				There was sinful woman in the city who learned that he was at table in the house of the Pharisee. Bringing an alabaster flask of ointment, she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and anointed them with the ointment.

				When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself, "If this man were prophet, he would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, that she is sinner."

				Jesus said to him in reply, "Two people were in debt to certain creditor. One owed five hundred days wages and the other owed fifty. Since they were unable to repay the debt, he forgave it for both. Which of them will love him more?"
