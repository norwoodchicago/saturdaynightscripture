When he had risen, early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons. She went and told his companions who were mourning and weeping. When they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
After this he appeared in another form to two of them walking along on their way to the country.  They returned and told the others; but they did not believe them either.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table. He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn't believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
