				As soon as morning came, the chief priests with the elders and the scribes, that is, the whole Sanhedrin, held council. They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Pilate questioned him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" He said to him in reply, "You say so." The chief priests accused him of many things. Again Pilate questioned him, "Have you no answer? See how many things they accuse you of." Jesus gave him no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Now on the occasion of the feast he used to release to them one prisoner whom they requested. Pilate asked, "Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" For he knew that it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed him over. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead. Pilate again said to them in reply, "Then what to do with the king of the Jews?" They shouted again, "Crucify him." Pilate said to them, "Why? What evil has he done?" They only shouted the louder, "Crucify him." So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them and, after he had Jesus scourged, handed him over to be crucified.
