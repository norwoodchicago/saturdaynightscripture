				Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought woman who had been caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				They said to him, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?" They said this to test him, so that they could have some charge to bring against him.

				Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger. 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				But when they continued asking him, he straightened up and said to them. "Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Again he bent down and wrote on the ground. And in response, they went away one by one, beginning with the elders. So he was left alone with the woman before him. Then Jesus straightened up and said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" She replied, "No one, sir."

				Then Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you."
