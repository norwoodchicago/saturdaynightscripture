				<p class="sj-litany">
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. He was changed before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
</p>
<p class="sj-litany">
Peter spoke out and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let's make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them. A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."

When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up, and don't be afraid."
