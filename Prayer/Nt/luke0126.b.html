			In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to town of Galilee called Nazareth, to virgin betrothed to man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. And coming to her, he said, "Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you."
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			She was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. 
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			Then the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end."
