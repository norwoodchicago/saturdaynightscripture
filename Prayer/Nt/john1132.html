				When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died." 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her weeping, he became perturbed and deeply troubled, and said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to him, "Sir, come and see." And Jesus wept. 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">				
				So the Jews said, "See how he loved him." But some of them said, "Could not the one who opened the eyes of the blind man have done something so that this man would not have died?" 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">				
				So Jesus, perturbed again, came to the tomb. It was cave, and stone lay across it. Jesus said, "Take away the stone."
