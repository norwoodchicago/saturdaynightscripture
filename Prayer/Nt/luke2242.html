 He came out and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him. When he was at the place, he said to them, "Pray that you don't enter into temptation."
 </p><p class="sj-litany">
He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and he knelt down and prayed, "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."
An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. In agony, he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. When he rose up from his prayer, he found  the disciples sleeping because of grief. He said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not undergo the test."
