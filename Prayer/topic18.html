				<p class="sj-litany">
					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 75</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
We give thanks to you, God.
We give thanks, for your Name is near.
Men tell about your wondrous works.
When I choose the appointed time,
I will judge blamelessly.
The earth and all its inhabitants quake.
I firmly hold its pillars.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!"
I said to the wicked, "Don't lift up the horn.
Don't lift up your horn on high.
Don't speak with a stiff neck."
For neither from the east, nor from the west,
nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.
But God is the judge.
He puts down one, and lifts up another.
For in Yahweh's hand there is a cup,
full of foaming wine mixed with spices.
He pours it out.
Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
But I will declare this forever,
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,
but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.				
				</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Solve my problems.  Amen.

"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'  But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.

<p class="sj-litany">	
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same? If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
