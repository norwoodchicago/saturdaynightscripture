				<h2 class="psalm-lead">Psalm 95</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
				Sing to Yahweh a new song!
				Sing to Yahweh, all the earth.
				Sing to Yahweh!
				Bless his name!
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany"> 
				Proclaim his salvation from day to day!
				Declare his glory among the nations,
				his marvelous works among all the peoples.
				For Yahweh is great, and greatly to be praised!
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
but Yahweh made the heavens.
Honor and majesty are before him.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
Give credit to Yahweh, you families of nations.
Give credit to Yahweh for his glory and strength.
Give credit to Yahweh the glory due to his name.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
Worship Yahweh in holy array.
Tremble before him, all the earth.
Say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns."
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
The world is firmly established.
It can't be moved.
He will judge the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
Let the sea roar, and its fullness!
Let the field and all that is in it exult!
Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy.
They will sing before the LORD, for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. 
He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his truth.
