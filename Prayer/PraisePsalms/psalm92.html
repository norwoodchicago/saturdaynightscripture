			<p class="sj-litany">
			It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praise to your name, Most High. To proclaim your love at daybreak, your faithfulness in the night, With the ten-stringed harp, with melody upon the lyre. For you make me jubilant, Lord, by your deeds. At the works of your hands I shout for joy. How great are your works, Lord! How profound your designs. 
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			A senseless person cannot know this. Fool cannot comprehend. Though the wicked flourish like grassd and all sinners thrive. They are destined for eternal destruction. But you, Lord, are forever on high. Indeed your enemies, Lord, indeed your enemies shall perish. All sinners shall be scattered. 
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			You have given me the strength of wild ox. You have poured rich oil upon me. My eyes look with glee on my wicked enemies. My ears shall hear what happens to my wicked foes. The just shall flourish like the palm tree and shall grow like cedar of Lebanon. Planted in the house of the Lord, they shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall bear fruit even in old age. They will stay fresh and green. Proclaim: "The Lord is just. My rock, in whom there is no wrong."
