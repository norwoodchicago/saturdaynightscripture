			<p class="sj-litany">
			I praise you, Lord, for you raised me up and did not let my enemies rejoice over me. O Lord, my God, I cried out to you for help and you healed me. Lord, you brought my soul up from Sheol. You let me live, from going down to the pit.
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			Sing praise to the Lord, you faithful. Give thanks to his holy memory. For his anger lasts but moment. His favor lifetime. At dusk weeping comes for the night. But at dawn there is rejoicing. Complacent, I once said, "I shall never be shaken." 
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			Lord, you showed me favor, established for me mountains of virtue. But when you hid your face I was struck with terror. To you, Lord, I cried out. With the Lord I pleaded for mercy: "What gain is there from my lifeblood, from my going down to the grave? Does dust give you thanks or declare your faithfulness? Hear, O Lord, have mercy on me. Lord, be my helper." 
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			You changed my mourning into dancing. You took off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness. So that my glory may praise you and not be silent. O Lord, my God, forever will I give you thanks.
