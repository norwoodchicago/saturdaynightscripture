			<p class="sj-litany">I thank you Lord, with all my heart. in the presence of the angels to you I sing. I bow low toward your holy temple. I praise your name for your mercy and faithfulness. For you have exalted over all your name and your promise. On the day I cried out, you answered. You strengthened my spirit.
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			All the kings of earth will praise you, Lord, when they hear the words of your mouth. They will sing of the ways of the Lord: "How great is the glory of the Lord!" The Lord is on high, but cares for the lowly and knows the proud from afar. Though I walk in the midst of dangers, you guard my life when my enemies rage.
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			You stretch out your hand. Your right hand saves me. The Lord is with me to the end. Lord, your mercy endures forever. Never forsake the work of your hands!
