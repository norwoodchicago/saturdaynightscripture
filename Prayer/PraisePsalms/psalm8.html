			<p class="sj-litany">
			Lord our God! How glorious in all the earth is your name! Your praise reaches as high as the heavens, from the mouths of children and infants. You have built a fortress against your enemies, to silence the foe and the rebel. 
			</p>
			<p class="sj-litany">
			When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set there, what are mortals, that you think of them, humans, that you visit them? Yet you made them little less than divine, crowned them with glory and majesty, made them lord of the works of your hands, put all things under their feet â€“ sheep and oxen, all of them, and the wild beasts also, birds of the air, and fish of the sea, and all that crosses the paths of the ocean.
