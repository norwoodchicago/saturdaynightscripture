			<p class="sj-litany sj-short">My soul rests in God alone...<span class="sj-click">click for more.</span></p>
			</p><p class="sj-litany">My soul rests in God alone, from whom comes my salvation. God alone is my rock and salvation, my fortress.	I shall never fall.
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			How long will you set yourself against man? You shall all be destroyed, like sagging wall or tumbled down fence! Even highly placed people plot to overthrow him. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. 
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			Selah My soul, be at rest in God alone, from whom comes my hope. God alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress. I shall not fall. My deliverance and honor are with God, my strong rock. My refuge is with God. Trust God at all times, my people! Pour out your hearts to God our refuge! 
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			Selah Mortals are mere breath, the sons of man but an illusion. On balance they rise. Together they weigh nothing. 
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			Do not trust in extortion. In plunder put no empty hope. On wealth that increases, do not set your heart. 
			</p><p class="sj-litany">
			One thing God has said. Two things I have heard. Strength belongs to God. So too, my Lord, does mercy, for you repay each man according to his deeds.
			</p><p class="sj-litany">				
			On our side is the Lord of Hosts, our sure defence is the God of Jacob.
