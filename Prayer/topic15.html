					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 31</h2>
				<p>
Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in distress.
My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief.
For my life is spent with sorrow,
my years with sighing.
My strength fails because of my iniquity.
My bones are wasted away.
</p>
<p>
Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors,
a horror to my acquaintances.
Those who saw me on the street fled from me.
I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man.
I am like broken pottery.
For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side,
while they conspire together against me,
they plot to take away my life.
But I trust in you, Yahweh.
I said, "You are my God."
</p>
<p>
My times are in your hand.
Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.
Make your face to shine on your servant.
Save me in your loving kindness.
Let me not be disappointed, Yahweh, for I have called on you.
Oh how great is your goodness,
which you have laid up for those who fear you,
which you have worked for those who take refuge in you.
				</p>
			
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p>
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I look to you to help me, to show me the way, to solve my problems. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.

He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray and not give up. 
</p>
<p>
There was a judge in a certain city who didn't fear God and didn't respect man. A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, 'Defend me from my adversary!'  For a long time the judge wasn't interested.  Eventually he thought, 'Though I neither fear God nor respect man, yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her persistance.'
			</p><p>
The Lord said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. Won't God help his chosen ones who are crying out to him day and night.  Will he be slow to anwer them? I tell you, he will see to it that justice is done for them quickly."
