				<p class="sj-litany">
				Do not reprove me in your anger, Lord, nor punish me in your wrath. Have pity on me, Lord, for I am weak. Heal me, Lord, for my bones are shuddering. My soul too is shuddering greatly. And you, Lord, how long? 
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Turn back, Lord, rescue my soul, save me because of your mercy. For in death there is no remembrance of you. Who praises you in Sheol? I am wearied with sighing. All night long I drench my bed with tears. I soak my couch with weeping. My eyes are dimmed with sorrow, worn out because of all my foes.
				</p><p class="sj-litany">
				Away from me, all who do evil! The Lord has heard the sound of my weeping. The Lord has heard my plea. The Lord will receive my prayer. My foes will all be disgraced and will shudder greatly. They will turn back in sudden disgrace.
