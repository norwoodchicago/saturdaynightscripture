								<p class="sj-litany">
Out of the depths I call to you, LORD. Lord, hear my cry! May your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
If you, LORD, keep account of sins, Lord, who can stand? But with you is forgiveness and so you are revered.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
I wait for the LORD. My soul waits and I hope for his word.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
My soul looks for the Lord more than sentinels for daybreak. More than sentinels for daybreak, let Israel hope in the LORD. For with the LORD is mercy, with him is plenteous redemption,
</p><p class="sj-litany">
And he will redeem Israel from all its sins.
