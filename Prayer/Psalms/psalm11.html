<p class="sj-litany">
In the Lord I take refuge. How can you tell me to flee like a bird to the mountains? "See! The wicked are bending the bow, their arrow is set on the string, to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart. In this tearing down of foundations what good can a good person do?" 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
The Lord in his holy temple, the Lord in heaven, enthroned. His eyes watch the world, they see everyone. The Lord examines the righteous and wicked, and the lover of violence he hates. On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone, and their drink will be scorching wind. For the Lord is just, and justice he loves; so the upright will see his face.
