<p class="sj-litany">
Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good,a his mercy endures forever. Let Israel say: his mercy endures forever. Let the house of Aaron say, his mercy endures forever. Let those who fear the LORD say, his mercy endures forever. 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
In danger I called on the LORD. The LORD answered me and set me free. The LORD is with me. I am not afraid. What can mortals do against me. The LORD is with me as my helper. I shall look in triumph on my foes. Better to take refuge in the LORDd than to put one's trust in mortals. Better to take refuge in the LORD than to put one's trust in princes. 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
All the nations surrounded me. In the LORD's name I cut them off. They surrounded me on every side. In the LORD's name I cut them off. They surrounded me like bees. They burned up like fire among thorns. In the LORD's name I cut them off. I was hard pressed and falling, but the LORD came to my help. The LORD, my strength and might, has become my savior. 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
The joyful shout of deliverance is heard in the tents of the righteous. "The LORD's right hand works valiantly. The LORD's right hand is raised. The LORD's right hand works valiantly." I shall not die but live and declare the deeds of the LORD. The LORD chastised me harshly, but did not hand me over to death. 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Open the gates of righteousness. I will enter and thank the LORD. This is the LORD's own gate, through it the righteous enter. I thank you for you answered me. You have been my savior. The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. By the LORD has this been done. It is wonderful in our eyes. 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
This is the day the LORD has made. Let us rejoice in it and be glad. LORD, grant salvation! LORD, grant good fortune! 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD. We bless you from the house of the LORD. The LORD is God and has enlightened us.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Join in procession with leafy branches up to the horns of the altar. You are my God, I give you thanks. My God, I offer you praise. Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, his mercy endures forever.
