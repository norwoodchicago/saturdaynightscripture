		<p class="sj-litany">				
		Blessed is he whose fault is removed,
		whose sin is forgiven.
		Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn't impute iniquity,
		in whose spirit there is no deceit.
		When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
		For day and night your hand was heavy on me.
		My strength was sapped in the heat of summer.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
		I acknowledged my sin to you.
		I didn't hide my iniquity.
		I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,
		and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
		For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found.
		Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.
		You are my hiding place.
		You will preserve me from trouble.
		You will surround me with songs of deliverance.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">	
		I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.
		I will counsel you with my eye on you.
		Don't be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding,
		who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you.
		Many sorrows come to the wicked,
		but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh.
		Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous!
		Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!
