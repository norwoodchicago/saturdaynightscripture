				<h2 class="psalm-lead">Psalm 38</h2>
<p class="sj-litany">
Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your wrath,
nor punish me in your exasperation.
For your arrows have shot me,
your hand presses hard on me.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,
neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
For my iniquities have buried me.
As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
My wounds are loathsome and corrupt
I have groaned in anguish from my heart.
Lord, all my pleas are before you.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany"> 
My groaning is not hidden from you.
My heart throbs.
My strength fails me.
The light of my eyes is gone.
My friends and my acquaintances stand aloof from my plague.
My relatives stay far away.
Those who seek after my life also lay traps.
Those who want to hurt me speak mischievous things,
and meditate deceits all day long.
 				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
But I, as a deaf man, don't hear.
I am as a mute man who doesn't open his mouth.
Yes, I am as a man who doesn't hear,
who doesn't rebuke them.
For I hope in you, Yahweh.
You will answer, Lord my God.
For I said, "Don't let them gloat over me,
or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."
For I am ready to fall.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">
My pain is continually before me.
For I will declare my iniquity.
I will be sorry for my sin.
But my enemies are vigorous and many.
Those who hate me without reason are numerous.
They who render evil for good are also adversaries to me,
because I follow what is good.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">				
				Don't forsake me, Yahweh.
My God, don't be far from me.
Hurry to help me,
Lord, my savior.
