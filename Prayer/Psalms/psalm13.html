				<h2 class="psalm-lead">Psalm 13</h2>
<p class="sj-litany"> How long, Lord, will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? How long must I nurse grief inside me, and in my heart a daily sorrow? How long are my foes to exult over me? 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Look at me, answer me, Lord my God. Fill my eyes with your light, lest I sleep in death, lest my enemies claim to have triumphed, lest my foes rejoice at my downfall. 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
But I trust in your kindness, my heart will rejoice in your help. I will sing to the Lord who was good to me.
