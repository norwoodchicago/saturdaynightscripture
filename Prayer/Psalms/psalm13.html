			<p class="sj-litany"> How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? How long must I nurse grief inside me, and in my heart a daily sorrow? How long are my foes to exult over me?

			<p class="sj-litany">

			</p>
			<p class="sj-litany">
			But I trust in your kindness. My heart will rejoice in your help. I will sing to the Lord who was good to me.
