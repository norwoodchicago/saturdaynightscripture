		<p class="sj-litany">
I will lift up my eyes to the hills.
Where does my help come from?
My help comes from Yahweh,
who made heaven and earth.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany">  
He will not allow your foot to be moved.
He who keeps you will not slumber.
He who keeps Israel
will neither slumber nor sleep.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany"> 
Yahweh is your keeper.
Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.
The sun will not harm you by day,
nor the moon by night.
				</p>
				<p class="sj-litany"> 
Yahweh will keep you from all evil.
He will keep your soul.
Yahweh will watch your coming and going,
from this time forward, and forever.
