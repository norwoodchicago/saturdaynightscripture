				<h2>Psalm 25</h2>
				<p class="sj-litany">
To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul, my God, in you I trust. Do not let me be disgraced. Do not let my enemies gloat over me. No one is disgraced who waits for you, but only those who are treacherous without cause.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Make known to me your ways, LORD. Teach me your paths. Guide me by your fidelity and teach me, for you are God my savior, for you I wait all the day long.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Remember your compassion and your mercy, O LORD, for they are ages old. Remember no more the sins of my youth. Remember me according to your mercy, because of your goodness, LORD.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Good and upright is the LORD, therefore he shows sinners the way. He guides the humble in righteousness 
and teaches the humble his way.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth toward those who honor his covenant and decrees. For the sake of your name, LORD, pardon my guilt, though it is great. 
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Who is the one who fears the LORD? God shows him the way he should choose. He will abide in prosperity and his descendants will inherit the land. The counsel of the LORD belongs to those who fear him and his covenant instructs them. My eyes are ever upon the LORD who frees my feet from the snare.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
Look upon me, have pity on me for I am alone and afflicted. Relieve the troubles of my heart. Bring me out of my distress. Look upon my affliction and suffering. Take away all my sins.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
See how many are my enemies. See how fiercely they hate me. Preserve my soul and rescue me. Do not let me be disgraced, for in you I seek refuge. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me.
</p><p class="sj-litany">
I wait for you, O LORD. Redeem Israel, O God, from all its distress!				</p>
				
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>

				<p class="sj-litany">
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I look to you to help me, to show me the way, to solve my problems. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.

				<div class="jumbotron"><h2>Matthew 6:27</h2>"Will any of you add a minute to your life by worrying?"</div>			
				<p class="sj-litany">
"Therefore don't be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?', 'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we wear?' For the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first God's Kingdom and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore don't be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day has its own evil."
