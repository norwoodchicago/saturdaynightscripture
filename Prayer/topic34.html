					  God, I need your help.  Please help me now.

				<h2>Psalm 130</h2>
				<p>
Out of the depths I call to you, LORD. Lord, hear my cry! May your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.
</p><p>
If you, LORD, keep account of sins, Lord, who can stand? But with you is forgiveness and so you are revered.
</p><p>
I wait for the LORD. My soul waits and I hope for his word.
</p><p>
My soul looks for the Lord more than sentinels for daybreak. More than sentinels for daybreak, let Israel hope in the LORD. For with the LORD is mercy, with him is plenteous redemption,
</p><p>
And he will redeem Israel from all its sins.
				</p>
				<h2>Let us pray</h2>
				<p>	
					Father in Heaven, it is you who are my God.  I put all things in your hands today. Be with me this day as my guide, my light, my strength.  Amen.

				<p>	
When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet and said to him, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died." When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit and was troubled. He said, "Where have you laid him?"  They told him, "Lord, come and see."
</p><p>
Jesus wept.
</p><p>
The Jews said, "See how much love he had for him!" Some of them said, "Couldn't this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?" Jesus groaned within and came to the tomb. It was a cave closed with a stone. Jesus said, "Take away the stone."
</p><p>
Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him, "Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."
</p><p>
Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed, you would see God's glory?"
They took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank you that you listened to me. I know that you always listen to me, but because of the people standing around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me." When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
</p><p>
He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.
</p><p>
Jesus said to them, "Untie him, and let him go."
